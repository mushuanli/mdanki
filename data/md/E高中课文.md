### Reading (P 2-3)  
**Realizing your potential**  
**实现你的潜力**  

Hello, everyone! Welcome to senior high school! Today is the start of a new term, the start of a three-year journey and the start of a promising future.  
大家好！欢迎进入高中阶段学习！今天，是新学期的开始，是一段三年旅程的开端，更是一个锦绣前程的起点。  

I can’t wait to describe to you what senior high school life is like. The path before you leads to a world full of challenges: a new environment, new knowledge and new ways of thinking. However, for those of you with a positive mind, opportunity lies in each challenge. When you rise to the challenges, you will have the opportunity to acquire great knowledge and enjoy personal growth. Most importantly, your time and effort at senior high school will open the door to your potential.  
我迫不及待地想要向你们描述高中生活的模样。你们面前的路通向一个充满挑战的世界，这里有新环境、新知识和新的思维方式。不过，对你们当中心态积极的人来说，每一个挑战中都蕴藏着机遇。在迎接挑战的时候，你们将有机会掌握大量的知识，并享受个人的成长。最重要的是，你在高中阶段度过的时光、付出的努力将会为你叩开潜能的大门。  

“What is potential?” you may ask. Put simply, potential is your natural ability that can be developed when you try hard enough. Who knows what beautiful works of art you will create, what medical advances you will make or what amazing technologies you will develop! The possibilities are endless, and I have confidence in your ability to make a difference to your family, to your community and to our country. Over the next three years, you will discover your potential while you develop as a student and as a person.  
你们也许会问：“什么是潜能？”简而言之，潜能就是当你足够努力时才可以开发的天赋。谁知道未来你们能创作出哪些精美的艺术品，实现哪些医学突破，或者开发出哪些不可思议的技术！可能性无穷无尽，而且我相信你们有能力改变你们的家庭、改变你们的社区、改变我们的国家。在今后的三年里，你们作为学生和个体成长的同时，将会发现自己的潜能。  

To fully realize your potential, it is important for you to make the most of our school resources. Take advantage of your classes, learn from your teachers and classmates, and make use of our school facilities. There are also a lot of school activities for you. Join a club or two, and take an active part in different sports.  
要想全面发挥自己的潜能，充分利用我们学校的资源很重要。要让学校课程为你所用，要向老师和同学请教，要善用学校的各种设施。学校还为你们准备了许多活动。要加入一两个俱乐部，并且积极地参与各项体育运动。  

Of equal importance are good study habits, useful skills and a positive attitude. Carefully plan your study, set clear goals and balance your schoolwork with other activities. As a senior high school student, you must make efforts to improve your communication and problem-solving skills. Last but not least, always look on the bright side and never lose hope, even in difficult situations. In time you will find yourself growing into a well-rounded individual.  
同样重要的还有良好的学习习惯、实用的技能以及积极的态度。要细致规划学习，设立清晰的目标，并且平衡好课业和课余活动的关系。作为一个高中生，须努力提高人际沟通和解决问题的技巧。最后但同样重要的是，要一直看到事情好的一面，即便身处困境，也永远不要失去希望。最终，你会发现自己已逐渐成长为一个全面发展的人。  

As Lao-Tzu wisely said, “A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” You need to make a continuous effort to train your mind and develop your character. Senior high school will help you learn and grow, yet you alone are responsible for realizing your great potential. Be confident, do your best and make us proud!  
正如老子睿智的箴言所说的那样：“千里之行，始于足下。”你们需要坚持不懈，努力去训练自己的头脑、培养自身的性格。高中阶段会帮助你们学习、成长，但是只有你们自己，才能肩负起发挥自身巨大潜能的责任。满怀信心，竭尽全力，让我们为你们感到骄傲吧！  

### Extended reading (P 11-12)  
John Li, a Chinese senior high school student, has spent a year studying in the UK. Read his article in the school magazine about his school life abroad.  

**School life in the UK**  

Last year, I had the chance to study at a British secondary school as an exchange student. I stayed with a lovely host family and went to school with their son, Daniel. We were both in year ten and we got on well. He is learning Chinese and will come to stay with me this year in China!  
去年，我有机会作为交换生到英国的一所中学读书。我寄宿在一个亲切友好的家庭，并与这家人的儿子丹尼尔一同上学。我们去年都读十年级，相处得很融洽。丹尼尔正在学习中文，今年要来中国与我一起学习生活。  

The British school day begins at 9 a.m. and ends at 4 p.m. Students usually have to learn nine subjects at secondary school. Every student in the UK must study English, Maths and the Science subjects: Biology, Chemistry and Physics. Students can also choose to study other subjects, such as History, Art and Business.  
英国的学校上午9点开始上课，下午4点放学。中学生通常要学习九门功课。英文、数学，以及科学课（生物、化学、物理）是必修课，学生们还可以选修其他课程，比如历史、艺术和商业。  

The classes are different from those in China. Each teacher has their own classroom and the students move around for every lesson. In most of my classes, there were only about 20 students. In the beginning, however, it was still tough for me to remember everyone’s name!  
英国的课堂与中国不同。每位老师都有自己的教室，学生们每节课走班上课。在我所上的大部分课上，都只有二十几个学生。然而刚开始时，我仍然很难记住所有人的名字！  

I enjoyed most of the classes, but some of them were quite challenging. Technology classes were fun. I made a clock to take home. The teacher helped me put the parts together. I like it so much that I still use it as my alarm! I found Maths quite easy and enjoyable because the material was less advanced in the UK than in China. However, learning in English was a great challenge for me. There were a lot of difficult English words, especially in Geography and Biology. Class discussion is very important in the UK, but I could not make a great contribution because sometimes I wasn’t able to express myself clearly in English. Although there was not as much homework as I was used to, it was still challenging. Fortunately, my teachers and classmates were always helpful and gave me lots of encouragement. My language skills improved over time.  
大部分课程我都喜欢，但是也有一些非常有挑战性。技术课很有意思。我做了一只钟带回家。老师帮助我完成了零件组装。我太喜欢这只钟了，现在还在用它当闹钟呢！我觉得数学很简单，学起来很愉快，因为英国的教材没有中国的难。不过，英文学习对我来说是一项巨大的挑战。难记的单词很多，特别是地理和生物词汇。在英国，课堂讨论很重要，可是我贡献不大，因为有时候我没办法用英文清楚地表达自己的观点。尽管作业不像以前那么繁重，却仍旧很有挑战性。幸好，老师和同学们一直都乐于帮助我，并给予我很多鼓励。渐渐地，我的语言能力提高了。  

During the hour-long lunchtime, I ate in the school dining hall. There were lots of options including bread and butter, chicken pie and puddings, but I still missed my mum’s cooking! After lunch, I often played on the school’s huge sports field with Daniel and his friends. Sometimes we just relaxed under a tree or sat on the grass.  
一小时的午餐时间，我在学校餐厅用餐。选择很丰富，有面包、黄油、鸡肉馅饼和布丁等等，但我还是想念妈妈做的菜！吃完午餐，我常常同丹尼尔，还有他的朋友们去学校的大运动场活动活动。有时候，我们就在树下小憩或者在草地上坐坐。  

After school, there were many clubs to join. The one that attracted me most was the Rugby Club. We played once a week, and it was great fun. Also, I enjoyed acting in the Theatre Club. I still have photos of myself acting in William Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream. Joining clubs was a great way to meet British students and make friends with them.  
放学后，有许多俱乐部可以参加。最吸引我的是橄榄球俱乐部。我们每周打一次球，真的很有趣。我也喜欢去戏剧俱乐部表演。我还留着自己参演莎士比亚《仲夏夜之梦》时的剧照。加入俱乐部是与英国学生相识、交友的好方法。  

I am glad to have the opportunity to experience this different way of life. I met some great people and learnt a lot about school life in the UK. Daniel and his family were fantastic hosts, and his friends were very nice as well. I can’t wait for Daniel to visit China!  
我很高兴有机会体验这种不同的生活方式。在英国我见到了一些很棒的人，也了解了英国校园生活的方方面面。丹尼尔和他的家人是非常棒的东道主，丹尼尔的朋友也十分友好。我迫不及待要让丹尼尔来中国了！  

## Unit 2 Let’s talk teens

> “家”是什么，我不知道，但烦恼和忧愁都在此中融化消灭。——冰心  

### Reading (P 16-17)  
**Strangers under the same roof?**  
**同一屋檐下的陌生人？**  

Does every dinner with your parents seem to turn into a battle? Have your once warm and open conversations become cold and guarded? Do you feel that you just cannot see eye to eye with them on anything? You are not alone. Heated arguments and cold silences are common between teenagers and their parents.  
与父母的每顿晚餐似乎都会变成一场战斗吗？您曾经热烈而公开的对话变得冷淡无情吗？您是否感到无法与他们在任何事情上保持一致？您并不孤单。激烈的争论和冷淡的沉默在青少年和他们的父母之间很常见。  

Teenagers’ physical changes may result in such family tensions. You may feel anxious that you are developing at a different rate to your friends, shooting up in height or getting left far behind. You might worry about your changing voice, weight problems or spots. When it all gets too much, your parents are often the first targets of your anger.  
青少年的身体变化可能会导致家庭紧张。您可能会担心自己与朋友的成长速度不同，身高升高或被甩在后面。您可能会担心自己的声音不断变化，体重问题或斑点，当一切变得过多时，父母通常是您生气的首要目标。  

It can be a big headache to balance your developing mental needs too. You enter a strange middle ground—no longer a small child but not quite an adult. You have both a new desire for independence and a continued need for your parents’ love and support. You feel ready to be more responsible and make decisions on your own. Unfortunately, your parents do not always agree and that makes you feel unhappy. “Why can’t they just let me go?” you may wonder. On the other hand, when you are struggling to control your feelings, you wish they could be more caring and patient—sometimes they forget that growing up is a rough ride. It can be difficult when your parents treat you like a child but expect you to act like an adult. All of this can lead to a breakdown in your relationship.  
平衡您不断发展的精神需求也可能是一大麻烦。您进入一个奇怪的中间地带-不再是小孩，而不再是成年人。您既有独立的新愿望，又有对父母的爱与支持的持续需求。您随时准备承担更大的责任，并自行做出决定。不幸的是，您的父母并不总是同意，这会使您感到不开心。“为什么他们不让我走？” 你可能想知道。另一方面，当您努力控制自己的感觉时，您希望他们能更加贴心和耐心-有时他们会忘记成长是艰难的旅程。当您的父母像对待孩子一样对待您，但又希望您像成年人一样行事时，可能会很难。所有这些都会导致您的人际关系破裂。  

Although sometimes it may seem impossible to get along as a family, you can take action to improve the situation. The key to keeping the peace is regular and honest communication. When you disagree with your parents, take a minute to calm down and try to understand the situation from their point of view. Perhaps they have experienced something similar and do not want you to go through the same pain.  
尽管有时候看起来像一家人一样不可能相处，但是您可以采取措施改善这种状况。维持和平的关键是定期和诚实的沟通。当您不同意您的父母时，请花点时间冷静下来，并尝试从父母的角度了解情况。也许他们经历过类似的事情，并且不想让您遭受同样的痛苦。  

After you have thought it through, explain your actions and feelings calmly, listen carefully, and address their concerns. Through this kind of healthy discussion, you will learn when to back down and when to ask your parents to relax their control.  
在仔细考虑之后，冷静地解释自己的行为和感受，认真倾听并解决他们的担忧。通过这种健康的讨论，您将学会何时退缩以及何时要求父母放松控制。  

Just remember that it is completely normal to struggle with the stress that parent-child tensions create, and that you and your parents can work together to improve your relationship. The good news is that this stormy period will not last. Everything will turn out all right in the end, and the changes and challenges of your teenage years will prepare you for adulthood.  
只需记住，与亲子关系紧张所产生的压力作斗争是完全正常的，而且您和您的父母可以共同努力改善您的关系。好消息是，这个风雨如磐的时期将不会持续。最后一切都会好起来的，而您少年时代的变化和挑战将使您为成年做好准备。

**Mama and Her Bank Account**  
**妈妈和她的银行帐户**  

Every Saturday night Mama would sit down by the kitchen table and count out the money Papa had brought home.  
每个星期六晚上，妈妈都会坐在厨房的桌子旁，数着爸爸带回家的钱。  

“For the rent.” Mama would count out the big silver pieces.  
“为了租金。” 妈妈会数出大银子。  

“For the groceries.” Another group of coins.  
“用于食品杂货。”另一组硬币。  

“I’ll need a notebook.” That would be my sister Christine, my brother Nels or me.  
“我需要一个笔记本。”那将是我的妹妹克里斯汀，我的兄弟内尔斯或我。  

Mama would put one or two coins to the side. We would watch with anxious interest. At last, Papa would ask, “Is that all?” And when Mama nodded, we could relax a little. Mama would look up and smile, “Good. We do not have to go to the Bank.” We were all so proud of Mama’s Bank Account. It gave us such a warm, secure feeling.  
妈妈会把一两个硬币放在一边。我们会以急切的兴趣观看。最后，爸爸会问：“就这样吗？”当妈妈点点头时，我们可以放松一下。妈妈会抬头微笑，“好。我们不必去银行。”我们都为妈妈的银行帐户感到骄傲。它给了我们如此温暖，安全的感觉。  

When Nels graduated from grammar school, he wanted to go on to high school. “It will cost a little money,” he said.  
内尔斯从语法学校毕业后，他想去上高中。他说：“这将花费一点钱。”  

Eagerly we gathered around the table. I took down a box and laid it carefully in front of Mama. This was the “Little Bank”. It was used for sudden emergencies, such as the time when Christine broke her arm and had to be taken to a doctor.  
我们热切地围在桌子旁。放下一个盒子，小心地放在妈妈面前。这就是“小银行”。它用于突发紧急事件，例如克里斯汀挽救她的手臂并不得不去看医生的时候。  

Nels listed the costs of the things he would need. Mama counted out the money in the Little Bank. There was not enough. “We do not want to go to the Bank,” she reminded. We all shook our heads.  
内尔斯列出了他需要的东西的费用。妈妈数出小银行里的钱。还不够。她提醒说：“我们不想去银行。”我们都摇了摇头。  

“I will work in Dillon’s grocery after school,” Nels volunteered.  
“放学后，我将在狄龙的杂货店工作，”内尔斯自愿参加。  

Mama gave him a bright smile and wrote down a number. “That’s not enough,” Papa said. Then he took his pipe out of his mouth and looked at it for a long time. “I will give up smoking,” he said suddenly.  
妈妈给了他灿烂的笑容，并写下了一个数字。“那还不够，”爸爸说。然后他从嘴里抽出烟斗，看了很久。“我会戒烟，”他突然说。  

Mama reached across the table and touched Papa’s arm. Then she wrote down another figure.  
妈妈伸出桌子，摸了摸爸爸的胳膊。然后她写下了另一个数字。  

“I will look after the Elvington children every Friday night,” I said. “Christine can help me.”  
“每周五晚上我会照顾艾文顿的孩子们，”我说。“克里斯汀可以帮助我。”  

Now there was enough money. We all felt very good because we did not have to go downtown and draw money out of Mama’s Bank Account.  
现在有足够的钱。我们所有人都感觉很好，因为我们不必去市中心并从妈妈的银行帐户中提款。  

So many things came out of the Little Bank that year: Christine’s dress for the school play, my little sister Dagmar’s operation ... Whatever happened, we always knew we still had the Bank to depend upon.  
银行账户解决了很多事情：克里斯汀穿的校服，我妹妹达格玛的手术……不管发生什么事，我们都知道我们还有妈妈的银行账户可以依靠。  

That was twenty years ago.  
那是二十年前。  

Last year I sold my first story. When the check came, I hurried over to Mama’s and put it in her lap. “For you,” I said,“to put in your Bank Account.”  
去年我卖掉了我的第一个故事。支票到来后，我急忙走到妈妈家，把它放在她的腿上。我说：“为您存入您的银行帐户。”  

I noticed for the first time how old Mama and Papa looked. Papa seemed shorter, and Mama’s hair was silver now.  
我第一次注意到爸爸妈妈的年龄，爸爸似乎矮了些，而妈妈的头发现在变成银白色。  

“Tomorrow,” I told Mama, “you must take it to the Bank.”  
我告诉妈妈，“明天，你必须把它带到银行。”  

“You will go with me, Katrin?”  
“你会和我一起去的，凯特琳？”  

“That won’t be necessary. Just hand it to the teller. He’ll pay it into your account.”  
“没必要。只需将其交给出纳员即可。他会把它存入您的帐户。”  

Mama looked at me. “There is no account,” she said. “In all my life, I’ve never been inside a bank.”  
妈妈看着我说：“哪有账户，一生中，我从未去过银行。”  

And when I didn’t—couldn’t—answer, Mama said seriously, “It is not good for little ones to be afraid—to not feel secure.”  
当我没有也无法回答时，妈妈认真地说道：“感到害怕，不感到安全，对小孩子来说不好。”

**Friendship on the rock: please advise!**  

**Amy**  
*Monday 12/10 9:13 p.m.*  

My best friend and I have been close for eight years. When I was an awkward primary school student, she was the popular girl who was willing to make friends with me. Since then, a close friendship has grown between us and she’s been almost like a sister to me. Whether we’re walking to school, doing homework or just hanging out at the weekend, we’re hardly out of each other’s sight. But last Saturday, she broke my heart, and I’m still picking up the pieces.

八年来，我和我最要好的朋友一直特别亲密。那时，我是个笨手笨脚的小学生，而她这个备受欢迎的女孩愿意和我做朋友。从那时起，我们就成了密友，对我，她一直就跟姐姐差不多。不论是去上学、做作业，还是周末出去玩儿，我们俩几乎都形影不离。可是上周六，她让我伤心了，我到现在还在收拾心情。  

Our original plan was to see a film at the cinema that afternoon. But in the morning, my friend posted a message on social media saying she had a cold. When I called her, she said she might not be able to make it to the cinema. “Don’t worry,” I said. “Get some rest. We can wait till you get better.”  
我们原先计划那天下午去电影院看电影。但早晨我朋友在社交媒体上发了一条信息，说她感冒了。我打电话过去，她说她也许不能去看电影了。“没事，”我说，“休息一下吧。等你好了我们再去。”  

Today, however, I received a horrible surprise. A classmate told me she had seen my friend chatting with another girl in a café on Saturday afternoon. How stupid I was! My friend’s “illness” was a complete lie! Instead of recovering at home, she was out having fun with someone else.  
可是今天，我惊呆了。一位同学告诉我，她周六下午在咖啡厅看见我朋友在和另一个女孩聊天。我傻透了！她所谓的“生病”是彻头彻尾的谎话。她并没有在家养病，而是跑到外面和别人乐呵去了。  

I was so angry that I avoided her during school all day, and I still don’t feel like responding to any of her online messages. The stress of this situation is killing me, and I’m at a loss what to do next.  
我气坏了，一整天我在学校都躲着她，到现在也不想回复她网上发过来的任何消息。这种情况带来的压力让我难受死了，我不知道接下来该怎么办。

*Monday 12/10 9:52 p.m.*  

I’m so sorry! But this friendship is worth saving: eight years is a long time! Don’t be so quick to judge your friend. Perhaps she knows she’s in the wrong and wants to apologize, or maybe she has a simple explanation for her behaviour. In any case, find an opportunity to have a full and frank talk with her. Listen to what she has to say, and be sure to explain how you feel. I’m sure you can solve this problem together.

为你感到抱歉！但是这份友情是值得挽回的：八年真久！别这么快就给你的朋友下结论。或许她知道自己错了，想向你道歉，又或许她可以明白地解释自己的行为。无论如何，找个机会和她深入、坦诚地谈谈。听听她怎么说，你也一定要说出自己的感受。我相信，你们一定能一起解决这个问题的。

*Tuesday 13/10 8:11 p.m.*  

I definitely understand how you feel. I also had a friend whom I trusted a lot. When I found out that I was tricked by him, I was really hurt and let go of our friendship. I know you value your friendship and want your friend to value it equally. However, if your friend ignores your feelings or makes you suffer, it’s time to rethink your relationship. Talk to her and decide whether this friendship is still important to you. It’s sad to move on, but you have to accept that friends come and go in life.  
戴维  
10 月 13 日 星期二 晚上 8:11  
你的心情我感同身受。我也曾经有一个特别信任的朋友。我发现自己被他欺骗之后，真的好伤心，我放弃了那份友谊。我知道你有多么珍视你们的友谊，并且希望你朋友也同样珍重它。可是，如果你朋友不在乎你的感受，让你难过，那就该反思一下你们的关系了。跟她谈谈，再决定这份友谊对你来说是不是仍然重要。放手固然令人伤感，但你必须接受这点——生命中，朋友就是有聚有散。  

### Extended reading ( P 39-40)  
**Of friendship**  
**论友谊**  

As we walk the “path of life”, we may sometimes wish to be alone with our own thoughts, for quiet periods of reflection can lead to personal improvement. However, when we seek to be alone, we must be careful that we do not always escape into our own world. Social life is also important to us. More often than not, close friendships will help smooth out the sometimes rocky road that we are all meant to travel.  
走在人生的道路上，有时我们可能希望独自思考，因为静思可以实现自我的完善。不过，在追求独处时，须小心，我们不能总是逃入自我的世界中。社交生活对我们同样重要。通常，亲密的友情能助我们踏平时而坎坷却又注定要经过的道路。  

As we live in social groups, there are many benefits of friendship that we can enjoy. Generally speaking, close friendships have three “fruits”: they may comfort the heart, advise the head and help us achieve the goals we set for ourselves. Through friendship, we can become happier, wiser and more satisfied humans.  
因为我们置身于社会群体中，我们可以享受到友谊的诸多益处。总体而言，亲密友谊的“硕果”有三：抚慰心灵，启迪思维，帮我们实现既定目标。通过友谊，我们可以变成更幸福、更睿智、更满足的人。  

The first fruit of friendship is the peace that comes from sharing with friends our joy, sadness, success and failure. Here, friendship has a double advantage—happiness takes on a greater meaning and a trouble shared becomes a trouble halved! Naturally, this kind of openness results from a close friendship. With true friends, we feel free to share our joy and sadness in full measure. We know that our friends will both respect our feelings and treasure these moments of closeness. Indeed, the human heart depends on such opportunities for comfort and protection.  
享我们喜悲成败所带来的平和心境。在此，友谊有双重优势——幸福有了更大的意义，而麻烦在分担之后减半。当然，这种开诚布公源于亲密无间的友谊。与真正的朋友，我们可以毫无顾忌、毫无保留地分享我们的欢乐和悲伤。我们知道，好友既会尊重我们的情感，也会珍视这些亲密的时刻。实际上，人的内心离不开这些机会来获取慰藉和庇护。  

The second fruit of friendship is the better understanding and judgement that may be achieved through conversations with well-meaning and wise friends. We often find it easier to recognize other people’s weaknesses than our own. As a result, if we are guided only by our own feelings, our judgements might be one-sided. On the other hand, our friends are better able to offer advice on important decisions that we all have to make. Also, when we want to talk our problems over with a friend, we have to put our thoughts into words first. This alone helps make our thoughts clearer and brings us a more thorough understanding of our problems.  
友谊的第二个硕果是，通过与善意和明智的朋友交谈可能获得更好的理解力和判断力。我们经常发现，认清别人的缺点远比认清我们自身的缺点要容易。因此，如果只跟着自己的感觉走，我们的判断可能就是片面的。另一方面，在我们必须要做出的重大决定上，朋友往往能给出更好的建议。此外，想和朋友聊聊自己的问题时，我们首先得把自己的想法付诸于语言。单是这点，就能让我们更好地厘清思路，并对自身的问题有更透彻的认识。  

The third fruit of friendship is the help that a friend may offer in many different ways. Sometimes a friend is even known as our “second self”. There are so many things in life that can only be achieved with the help of friends. Friends may have many different ideas and skills. They can help us achieve what we want during life and, perhaps, even after death.  
友谊的第三个硕果是朋友以各种不同的方式可能为我们提供的帮助。有时，朋友甚至被誉为我们的“第二个自己”。生活中有太多事，只有在朋友的帮助下才能成功。朋友可能拥有诸多不同的想法和技能。他们能帮助我们在生前，甚至是在我们故去之后，获得我们想要之物。  

Finally, it should be pointed out that enjoying the company of a crowd is not the same as being with friends. Friends should be carefully chosen and relationships carefully developed. In this way, we can better walk the “path of life” with the comfort, advice and help from our trusted friends.  
最后，需要指出的是，与众人为伍不等于有朋友相伴。朋友要谨慎选择，友情需用心经营。如此，我们才能在挚友的抚慰、建议和帮助下，更好地走过“人生之路”。

**Teen faints after skipping meals**  
**多餐未进食女生晕厥**  

STONECHESTER—A teenage girl fainted yesterday at Stonechester High School after skipping meals.  
来自斯通彻斯特的报道：昨日，斯通彻斯特高中一名女生多餐未进食后晕厥。  

Jennifer Jones, 15, told friends in her class that she was feeling unwell. She then passed out in her morning PE lesson and was rushed to hospital.  
珍妮弗·琼斯，十五岁，曾告诉同班朋友自己感觉不适，后来在上午的体育课上晕厥，随即被紧急送往医院。  

Jennifer was found to have dangerously low blood sugar levels and was treated immediately. Her worried parents told the doctor that their daughter missed breakfast that day and hardly touched her dinner the night before. Fortunately, she is now out of danger. Her doctor says that she will make a full recovery in a day or two.  
医生发现珍妮弗的血糖已经低到了很危险的程度，于是马上对其进行治疗。珍妮弗的父母忧心忡忡，他们告诉医生，女儿当天早晨未进食，前一天的晚餐也几乎丝毫未动。幸运的是，珍妮弗已经脱离了危险。主治医生预计，珍妮弗一两天就能康复。  

Jennifer’s classmates hope to see her back at school soon. They say that she has struggled with eating problems for a long time. “Jennifer thought that skipping meals would be a simple way to reach her target weight,” her friend Laura Williams told our reporter. “She has not eaten breakfast for the last few months. She told me she had trouble concentrating in class. I warned her that skipping meals was unhealthy, but she wouldn’t listen.”  
珍妮弗的同学希望她能尽快返回学校。他们说，珍妮弗和进食问题较劲已经很久了。“珍妮弗以为不吃饭就可以轻松减到她的目标体重。”她的朋友劳拉·威廉姆斯告诉记者，“最近几个月，她一直不吃早餐。她对我说，她上课很难集中注意力。我提醒过她，不吃饭有害健康，可她不听。”  

Jennifer’s case is a reminder of the dangers of the unhealthy weight-loss habits that have become common among teenagers of both sexes. In a society where being thin is often seen as being beautiful, teenagers sometimes turn to extreme methods to slim down quickly. According to a recent survey of senior high school students’ lifestyles, almost one fifth of teenagers regularly skip meals, one in ten over-exercise and four per cent even take weight-loss medicine. Health experts are concerned about these figures. They are increasing their efforts to educate teenagers about the side effects of losing weight too quickly. They have also warned them against using such extreme methods.  
珍妮弗的案例提醒我们，青少年中无论男女，已较为常见的不健康减肥习惯存在危险。在一个往往以瘦为美的社会中，不时有青少年采取极端方式快速瘦身。近期一项针对高中生生活习惯的调查表明，近1/5的青少年经常性地不吃饭，1/10运动过度，4%甚至服用减肥药。这些数据引起了健康专家的关注。他们加大力度教育青少年有关快速减肥引起的不良反应，并提醒青少年不要采取类似极端的方式。  

“These so-called ‘quick-fix methods’ prove to be harmful to teenagers. It is normal for teenagers to be slightly overweight and there is no reason why they should be worried. However, for those who are dangerously overweight, it is very important that they try to lose weight properly,” said an expert.  
“这些所谓的‘急速减肥法’已证实对青少年有害。青少年轻微超重是正常现象，没有理由为此焦虑。不过，如果超重到危险程度，尝试以适当方式减重是十分重要的。”一位专家表示。  

She pointed out that it is important to have a healthy balanced diet since teenagers are still growing and their bodies need a lot of nutrition to function well. If they do not take in enough food, they may feel weak and get ill easily. She added, “What’s more, they should keep regular hours and get plenty of exercise to stay energetic and fit. We strongly encourage all teenagers to follow these lifestyle tips, because living well is the safest and most effective way to get into shape.”  
她指出，健康均衡的饮食十分重要，因为青少年正在发育，需要大量营养以维持正常身体机能。如果食物摄入不足，青少年会感觉体虚乏力，容易生病。她补充说：“此外，青少年还应作息规律，多参加运动，才能精力旺盛、身体健康。我们强烈推荐所有青少年遵从这些生活方式的建议，因为好好生活是最健康、最有效的塑身方式。”

**Don’t judge a book by its cover**  
**不要以貌取人**  

“Don’t judge a book by its cover,” the old saying goes. Unfortunately, as a teenager, that is often exactly what you do to yourself. Dark thoughts about your physical appearance can hang over you all the time like a rain cloud. Do I look fat in these jeans? Do others think I am too short? Is everyone laughing at my new hairstyle behind my back? These thoughts can have a negative effect on people of any shape or size, both male and female, and it is important to guard against the causes behind them.  
古语说得好：“不要以貌取人。”可惜的是，作为青少年，你们恰恰却经常以貌取己。关于外表的负面思绪可能会像乌云一样始终笼罩着你。我穿这条牛仔裤是不是显胖？别人会不会觉得我太矮？大家背地里是不是都在嘲笑我的新发型？无论男女，不管什么样的体形或身高，人们都会受到这些想法的负面影响，而防备这些思绪背后的成因就成了一件重要的事情。  

Standards of beauty in the media can have a big influence on what you think of your physical appearance. Teens who try to copy the looks of their favourite stars are fighting a losing battle—these standards are simply impossible for most of the population to live up to. They will only end up feeling worse about themselves.  
媒体的审美标准会对你如何看待自己的外表产生很大影响。那些试图模仿他们最喜爱的明星形象的青少年们，正在打一场无望取胜的仗——因为对于大多数人来说，这些标准都难以企及。到头来，他们只会觉得自己更糟。  

Your friends also influence the way you view your physical appearance. If you have friends who are good-looking or have a great fashion sense, it can feel like you are living in their shadow. For children of the digital age, social media makes this problem even worse. Your friends may post a never-ending series of photos online to show off their beautiful dresses or strong bodies, and it becomes easier for you to compare yourself to them. This has proved to have a negative effect on what you think of your physical appearance.  
朋友也会影响你对自己外表的看法。如果你有朋友长得好看，或者很有时尚品位，你会觉得自己活在他们的阴影下。对于数字时代的孩子们来说，社交媒体会让这个问题变得更加棘手。你的朋友可能会无休止地在网上发自拍，炫耀他们漂亮的衣服或强壮的体格，你会更容易陷入和他们的比较之中。有证据显示，这种行为会对你如何评价自己的外表产生负面影响。  

These external influences are always present, but there are certainly ways to deal with them. First of all, be careful not to follow popular beauty standards blindly. They are out of reach for 99% of us, so it is better to just forget about them.  
这些外部影响始终存在，不过我们当然也有办法应对它们。首先要审慎，不要盲从流行的审美标准。这些标准，我们之中 99% 的人都是达不到的，所以最好不要理会它们。  

Another tip is to remind yourself that you are unique. Keep in mind that your family and friends love you just the way you are. Talk about your feelings with someone you trust. Hearing how much they value you can help you feel comfortable in your own skin. Focusing on your strengths also helps you build your confidence. Everyone has their own talents—you may be good at painting or playing the piano, so take pride in things you do well instead of worrying about things you cannot change.  
还有一个办法是你要提醒自己你是独一无二的。你要记住，你的家人和朋友都喜爱你本来的样子。可以和你信任的人谈谈自己的感受。听听他们有多么在乎你，将有助于你更好地接受自己的形象。专注于自己的强项也能帮你建立自信。每个人都有自己的天赋——你也许擅长画画或弹钢琴，所以要为自己擅长的事感到自豪，而不要为你无法改变的事而烦恼。  

Finally, it is a good idea to try to direct your attention away from negative thoughts. To achieve this, you should do something you enjoy. Read a book you like, or take part in a social activity, like playing a ball game with your friends. These things can help you take your mind off matters that worry you and make you feel good about yourself.  
最后，尽力转移你在这些消极想法上的注意力也是一个不错的办法。为了做到这一点，你应该做一些你乐在其中的事。读一本你喜欢的书，或者参加一项社交活动，比如和朋友们一起打球。这些事能帮你暂时忘却那些让你烦心的事，让你对自己的感觉好一些。  

You may often judge yourself by what is on the outside, not on the inside. However, like a book, your contents are much more important than your cover. If you can learn to see the good things about yourself-your individuality, your value to others, your achievements—you will soon begin to love yourself just the way you are.  
自我评价时，你可能常常注重外在，而不是内在。然而就像一本书，内容要远比封面重要。如果你能学会看到自己的优点——你的个性、你对他人的价值、你的成就——你很快就会爱上自己本来的样子。

**Behind the scenes 幕后**  

Hello, everyone! Let me start by asking you a question: what’s the first thing you notice about a film? The acting? The music? Maybe the amazing sets? Whatever your answer is, there’s always a lot more to it than first meets the eye. Actually, the film you see on the screen is the product of a huge amount of hard work, most of which takes place behind the scenes. Today, I’ll give you a brief introduction to some aspects of film-making you might not be familiar with.  
大家好！让我来先问你们一个问题作为开场：对于一部电影你首先会注意什么？表演？配乐？也许是令人惊叹的布景？无论你们的答案是什么，事情总要比你们认为的要复杂得多。事实上，你在银幕上看到的电影是大量艰苦工作的产物，其中大部分工作发生在幕后。今天我将就电影制作中你们可能不太熟悉的几个方面做一个简单的介绍。  

To begin with, I’d like to draw your attention to an important factor of a film—sound effects. These are often added after a scene has been shot and might not be made in the way you would expect. For example, in Jurassic Park, the sounds of different animals, including a baby elephant and a tiger, were mixed by a computer to make a dinosaur roar. The sound of the doors opening in the Star Trek films was made simply by pulling a sheet of paper out of an envelope.  
首先，我想请你们注意电影的一个重要元素——音效。音效通常是在一个场景拍摄完成之后添加的，而且可能是以你意想不到的方式制作的。例如，《侏罗纪公园》中恐龙的吼叫声，是用包括小象和老虎在内的不同动物的声音通过电脑合成的。在《星际迷航》系列电影里，开门的声音不过是通过从信封里抽取纸张来实现的。  

Another aspect I attach great importance to is visual special effects. CGI has been frequently used in film-making as a special effects technology. Generally, scenes requiring CGI are filmed in front of a green screen in the studio. As green doesn’t match any natural hair or skin colour, actors can be easily separated from the background. This enables CGI effects to be added later. The Quidditch scenes in the Harry Potter films were made in this way with the actors jumping up and down in front of a green screen. However, the aid of computers isn’t always preferred. Peter Jackson, director of The Lord of the Rings films, took a creative approach—he used clever camera angles to make characters seem bigger or smaller than they really were.  
另一个我认为非常重要的方面是视觉特效。CGI（计算机生成影像）作为一种特效技术在电影制作中已经很常用。一般来说，需要使用CGI的场景会在工作室的绿幕前拍摄。因为绿色与任何自然的人类发色或肤色都不同，演员可以轻易地与背景分离。这使得在后期添加CGI效果成为可能。“哈利·波特”系列电影中魁地奇比赛的场景就是通过演员在绿幕前上下跳跃这种方式制作的。不过，计算机辅助并不总是受到青睐。“指环王”系列电影的导演彼得·杰克逊采用了一种创造性的方法——他利用各种巧妙的拍摄角度，使剧中角色看起来比实际更大更小。  

Props also contribute to a film’s success. To make a film look real, great effort must sometimes be made to research, find and build objects. Director James Cameron spent six months looking at and revising plans of the Titanic in order to build a full-sized model for his 1997 film. He talked to historians to ensure that the details were correct and even went down to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean to see what was left of the ship for himself. It took 500 workers 100 days to build the fine model, not to mention the thousands of props inside.  
道具也为一部电影的成功助力。为了让电影看起来逼真，有时必须付出巨大的努力去研究、寻找和构建物体。导演詹姆斯·卡梅隆花了半年时间研究和修正“泰坦尼克号”的图纸，为的是在他1997年的电影中制作一个全尺寸模型。他和历史学家进行交流以确保细节无误，甚至亲自潜到大西洋海底查看“泰坦尼克号”的残骸。为了制作这个精致的模型，500名工人用了100天，更不用说内部还有成千上万的道具了。  

My lecture today may not be able to do justice to all the work people have done behind the scenes. Just as the poor passengers on the real Titanic saw the tip of the iceberg, what we see on the cinema screen is just the tip of the huge iceberg of film-making. Hopefully, next time you go to the cinema, you’ll spare a thought for all those talented people behind the scenes. They have worked for months and even years so that you can have two hours of enjoyment!  
我今天的讲座，可能无法对所有的幕后工作者给予公正的评价。正如“泰坦尼克号”上可怜的乘客看到的冰山一角一样，我们在影院银幕上看到的也只是电影制作这座巨大冰山的一角而已。希望下次你们走进电影院时，能想一想所有那些才华出众的幕后工作者。他们工作了数月甚至是数年，如此你们才能有两个小时的愉悦时光！

**A beginner’s guide to exercise 体育锻炼入门**  

You want to start doing exercise? Congratulations! You have just taken your first step towards a new and improved you!  
想开始锻炼身体了吗？祝贺你！你已经向新的、更好的自己跨出了第一步。  

**Understanding the benefits of exercise**  
**了解锻炼的益处**  

Most people assume that regular exercise does wonders for the body and mind—but what exactly are its health benefits? To start with, physical activity increases the efficiency of your heart and lungs. During exercise, your heart and lungs must work harder. This extra effort makes them grow stronger over the long term. It has also been proven that active people tend to have better immune systems and are at lower risk of diseases. Moreover, exercise is good for your mental health. Working out can help you reduce stress and get over negative feelings. Some studies even show that exercise improves certain brain functions, meaning you could actually exercise your way to better performance at school!  
大多数人都认为经常锻炼对身心大有益处——不过，锻炼究竟对健康有哪些好处呢？首先，体育活动能增强心肺功能。在锻炼时，你的心脏和肺必须更卖力地工作。久而久之，这些额外的工作使它们变得更强壮。有证据表明，经常锻炼的人往往免疫系统会更好，患病的风险更低。另外，锻炼对心理健康有好处。锻炼身体能帮你缓解心理压力，克服负面情绪。甚至有研究显示锻炼可改善某些大脑机能，也就是说，通过锻炼，你确实可以提高自己的学习成绩。

**Planning your exercise routine**  
**规划日常锻炼**  

When you plan an exercise routine, the first thing to consider is what you expect to improve: heart and lung efficiency, muscle strength or flexibility. Aerobic activities, like jogging, swimming and skiing, develop your heart and lungs. Strength training, such as pull-ups and weightlifting, increases muscle strength and encourages bone development. Flexibility training, including gymnastics and tai chi, helps stretch your muscles and improve your body’s range of movement. These types of exercise all play a role in a healthy routine. Above all, choose activities you enjoy because, in this way, you’re more likely to stick with them.  
在做日常锻炼的规划时，首先要考虑的是你想要提升哪方面：是心肺功能，还是肌肉强度抑或柔韧性。像慢跑、游泳和滑雪这样的有氧运动，能增强心肺功能。力量训练，比如引体向上和举重，能增加肌肉强度，促进骨骼发育。柔韧性训练，包括体操和太极拳，有助于舒展肌肉，增大肢体活动幅度。在一套健康的日常锻炼项目中，以上三种训练都是不可或缺的。而最重要的是，要挑选你喜欢的项目，因为这样才更有可能持之以恒。

**Eating and drinking right**  
**饮食得当**  

Like cars that run on petrol, your body burns carbohydrates for energy. Foods like noodles, rice, fruit and vegetables give your body plenty of carbohydrates to keep up your energy during a long workout. To help your muscles recover and repair themselves after exercise, you need to eat foods rich in protein, such as fish, eggs and milk products. When to eat is also of great importance. In general, you should have your meal an average of 1.5 to 2.5 hours before exercising. Do not eat immediately after exercise; instead, wait at least 30 minutes after a typical routine, or as much as an hour after a hard workout. Remember to drink throughout exercise to make up for water lost to sweat.  
就像汽车要烧汽油才能跑，你的身体也要燃烧碳水化合物来获得能量。米面果蔬等食物为身体提供丰富的碳水化合物，使你有充足的能量做长时间运动。锻炼后，为帮助肌肉恢复和自我修复，你需要吃些高蛋白食物，比如鱼、蛋和乳制品。什么时间吃也很重要。一般情况下，应该在锻炼之前一个半到两个半小时进食。运动后不要马上吃东西，如果是常规锻炼，至少过半小时再吃，如果是高强度锻炼，就需要等一小时后再吃。锻炼过程中别忘了喝水，以弥补出汗损耗的水分。

**Avoiding injury**  
**避免受伤**  

To prevent soft tissue injury, make sure that you wear proper clothes and equipment when exercising. You should also start small and slowly work your way to a longer and harder exercise routine to avoid getting hurt. Finally, remember to warm up before exercising and stretch at the end of your workout.  
So, now you know the benefits of exercise and how to do it safely and effectively. What are you waiting for?  
为避免软组织受伤，锻炼时一定要穿戴合适的衣服和护具。此外，刚开始锻炼强度要小，要循序渐进地增加锻炼的时间和强度，以防受伤。最后，记住锻炼前要热身，结束后要拉伸。  
现在，你已经明白了锻炼的好处，也知道如何安全高效地锻炼。那么，你还在等什么呢？

**Finding a balance: my tai chi experience 找到平衡：我的太极体验**  

When my friend first suggested that we join the new Tai Chi Club at school, I hesitated. I always believed tai chi was for old people. After the first class, however, I had to admit that I had been wrong about tai chi. It was amazing! One year later, I can honestly say it has had a huge effect on me physically and mentally. Just as importantly, practising tai chi has inspired me to explore the Chinese culture behind it.  
一开始，当朋友建议我们参加学校新成立的太极俱乐部时，我犹豫了。我过去一直觉得太极是老年人的运动。不过，上完第一节课后，我不得不承认，我之前对太极的认识是错误的。太极实在是太神奇了。一年后，我可以实话实说了，太极对我的身心都产生了巨大的影响。同样重要的是，练习太极还激励了我去探索其背后的中国文化。  

The first few tai chi classes were fun and easy, and the moves really caught my imagination, with descriptive names like “white crane spreading its wings” and “golden rooster standing on one leg”。When I asked my coach where these interesting names came from, he told me about the history of tai chi. Zhang Sanfeng, a 13th-century Taoist, was said to have invented tai chi after drawing inspiration from a fight between a snake and a bird. However, nowadays people tend to believe that Chen Wangting, a 17th-century master of Chinese martial arts, developed tai chi based on martial arts skills. No wonder some tai chi moves are named after animals—Chinese martial arts have a long-standing practice of imitating animals. Chen Wangting’s original set of moves is called Chen-style tai chi, but other styles of tai chi have since been developed, including Yang-style, Wu-style and Sun-style.  
前几节太极课非常有趣，也不难学，像“白鹤亮翅”“金鸡独立”这些很形象的招式名称确实让我兴趣满满。当我问教练，这些有趣的名称从何而来时，他和我说了太极的历史。传说十三世纪时，一个叫张三丰的道士从蛇与鸟的缠斗中汲取灵感，创立了太极。不过如今人们倾向于认为太极是十七世纪的武学大师陈王廷根据武术技巧演化而来的。由于中国武术中模拟动物的做法由来已久，太极的部分招式以动物来命名也就不足为奇了。陈王廷最初创编的招式称为陈氏太极，后来也发展出了其他门类的太极，包括杨式太极、吴氏太极和孙氏太极。  

After learning the basics of tai chi in those first few classes, I found myself bored and aching from doing the same moves over and over again. Luckily, my coach taught me how to relax my muscles and focus on peace of mind while performing the routine. With these requirements of tai chi in mind, I found to my satisfaction that my balance and flexibility slowly improved, that I was able to do more difficult moves, and that my love for tai chi returned stronger than ever.  
学完前几节太极基础课之后，我发现一遍又一遍重复这些招式让我心生厌倦，而且肌肉酸痛。幸运的是，教练教会了我放松肌肉的方法，以及在日常练习时如何注意心境的平和。将太极的这些要求铭记于心，慢慢地，我发现自己的平衡能力和柔韧性得到了改善，我可以尝试一些难度更大的招式，我对太极的热爱又回来了，而且比以前更强烈，这令我十分满意。  

In time, I began to look into the ancient Chinese culture behind tai chi. I discovered that tai chi is deeply rooted in the Chinese philosophy of yin and yang, which are believed to form the unity of opposites. Neither can exist independent of the other; for example, there is no shadow without light. The practice of tai chi aims to maintain the balance of yin and yang in the body through opposite movements: forwards and backwards, up and down, left and right, breathing in and breathing out. Eventually, tai chi brings about a state of physical balance and mental peace.  
我不失时机地开始探寻太极背后的中国古代文化。我发现，太极深深地扎根于中国的阴阳学说之中。人们认为阴和阳构成了对立统一，彼此不能独立存在，比如，没有光就不会有影子。练习太极旨在通过一些相对的动作——进退、上下、左右、吐纳——来维持人体内部的阴阳调和。最终，太极可以带来一种身心平衡的状态。  

A year of practising tai chi has had a positive effect on my everyday life. I sleep better at night, and I am more energetic during the day. I feel happier and more confident. Tai chi has taught me to relax my mind, enabling me to stay cool in stressful situations. I am sure I will continue to practise tai chi and enjoy the benefits it has brought me.  
一年练习太极的经历已经对我的日常生活产生了积极的作用。晚上我睡得更香，白天则精力更充沛。幸福感倍增，人也更加自信。太极让我学会了放松心态，使我在有压力的环境下也能冷静应对。我相信我一定会继续练习太极，并不断地享受太极带给我的好处。

**10 January, a wedding ceremony, India**  
**一月十日，一场婚礼，印度**  

When Nadim invited me to his sister’s wedding, I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime. I was definitely not wrong!  
当纳迪姆邀请我参加他妹妹的婚礼时，我觉得这是个千载难逢的好机会。结果我还真没猜错！  

The wedding ceremony took place in a brightly decorated hotel room. There were hundreds of guests, all dressed up in formal, colourful clothes. According to tradition, the bride was wearing an eye-catching red silk sari.  
婚礼在一间装饰华美的酒店包房内举行。到场宾客数以百计，个个身着色彩艳丽的礼服。遵照传统，新娘身穿一袭分外夺目的红丝绸莎丽。  

I did not understand all of the traditional customs, but a few made a deep impression on me. One was the bridegroom’s entrance on a beautiful white horse. I had never seen that back home! Another was the part when Nadim’s father proudly led his daughter through the rows of seats to her husband. It reminded me of my sister’s wedding. Although our cultures are so different, the smiling faces are the same.  
不是所有的传统习俗我都了解，但有一些给我留下了深刻的印象。一个是新郎入场时竟骑着一匹俊美的白马。这我在国内可从未见过！再就是纳迪姆的父亲自豪地领着女儿，穿过一排排座位走向新郎的环节。这一幕让我想起了我妹妹的婚礼。尽管文化殊异，但含笑的面孔却是一样的。  

The customs that followed were anything but ordinary. The couple joined hands and walked around a small fire four times. Then they took seven steps together by the fire, and with each step made a different promise about how they were going to support each other and live together happily. It was very romantic!  
接下来的风俗也都不同寻常。新婚夫妇携手围着一个小火堆走上四圈，然后在火堆旁一起走七步，每走一步，都要立一条誓言，誓言里讲的都是二人将来会如何相互扶持，如何幸福地共同生活。真是太浪漫了！  

After the ceremony, it was time for the celebrations. That is a story for another day, but let’s just say there was a lot of dancing. Now I know I have two left feet...and both of them hurt!  
仪式之后，就是欢庆的时刻了。这个话题改日再聊，但是先这么说吧，舞跳了不少。现在我只知道我有两只左脚，而且都疼得不行！

**二月二十六日，里约狂欢节，巴西**  

The summer heat hit me as soon as I got off the flight. No wonder people from Rio take a week off for this happy occasion. I could feel it already—the Carnival was in the air!  
一下飞机，就有一股暑热袭来。难怪里约人民要为这个欢乐的庆典休息一个星期。我已经感觉到了——这狂欢节的气氛！  

To experience the spirit of the Carnival for myself, I went to a street party. Luckily, I arrived just in time the show was about to begin as I took my place in the merry crowd. I could see a group of around 20 Brazilian dancers and a band in fancy costumes standing in the street. Some of them carried flags, which blew in the wind. The crowd waited with excitement.  
为了切身体验狂欢节的精神，我加入了一个街头派对。来得早不如来得巧——我刚在欢乐的人群中找好位置，表演就要开始了。我看到一群人，其中有大约二十名巴西舞者以及一支乐队，他们身着华丽的服装站在街头，有人还拿着旗子，旗子随风飘荡着。人们激动地翘首以待。  

Then there was an explosion of bright colours and lively music, and the group jumped into action. The band started playing an energetic samba beat, the dancers twisted and turned, and the crowd began to cheer, clap and sing. The whole group started marching down the street. The Carnival current carried us through the ever-growing sea of people, dancing all the way. Iceboxes of soft drinks and beer lined the narrow streets, and the smell of roasted meat filled the air as we passed wave after wave of street stands. I was so caught up in the party fever that I hardly noticed five hours fly by!  
突然，鲜艳的色彩和热烈的音乐 喷薄而出，歌舞队应声一跃而起。乐队奏起劲爆的桑巴节拍，跳舞的人扭动腰身，人群开始欢呼、鼓掌、歌唱。歌舞队全体开始沿街前行。狂欢节的人潮裹挟着我们在越来越浩瀚的人海中穿行，走一路跳一路。装着饮料啤酒的冰柜沿狭长的街道一溜排开，当我们经过一波又一波的街边摊时，空气中弥漫着烤肉的香味。我深深地沉迷于派对的狂热中，不知不觉五个小时已经过去了。  

Even as I lay in bed that evening, the bright colours and lively music were still swimming all around me. What an amazing first day in Rio!  
即使晚上我躺在床上的时候，那鲜艳的色彩和热烈的音乐依然在我脑海中盘旋游弋。里约首日，多么奇妙的一天！

**A precious family dinner 弥足珍贵的团圆饭**  

It is just past five o’clock on the Chinese New Year’s Eve, and the dinner table is already covered with white china plates and bowls, full of all sorts of dishes: chicken, duck, pork, fish and vegetables. Luo Yan, 29, lifts the cover of a large bowl to breathe in the rich smell of the soup his wife and mother have prepared. Luo Yan’s son, Bofeng, happily takes a bite of the chicken his grandfather has selected for him.  
除夕刚过五点钟，饭桌上已经摆满了白瓷碗碟、鸡鸭鱼肉和蔬菜，满满当当的各色菜肴。二十九岁的罗言掀开一个大碗的盖子，嗅着母亲和妻子煲的汤所散发出的浓香。他的儿子博峰美滋滋地咬了一口爷爷给挑好的鸡肉。  

Six-year-old Bofeng has not seen his grandparents for almost a year, and he is full of joy and excitement. Indeed, the whole family could not be happier to be together. Despite the cold outside, their happy faces fill the air with warmth while merry laughter rings throughout the house. Luo Yan and his wife and son have settled in the big city, far away from their hometown. Every year, they travel back for the Spring Festival, for their dream of “three generations under the same roof”.  
六岁的博峰都快一年没见爷爷奶奶了，他满心喜悦和激动。的确，一家人再没有比团团圆圆更高兴的事了。虽然外面天寒地冻，他们幸福的脸庞却让屋内的空气暖洋洋的，欢声笑语处处可闻。罗言一家三口已经在大城市定居，离家乡很远。不过，他们每年都回老家过春节，以实现他们“三代同堂”的梦想。  

The Luo family’s journey back to their hometown was a long and tiring one just a few years ago. However, the highspeed train has made it much more convenient for them to go back home. During the five-hour trip, they chatted excitedly with each other, their minds full of thoughts about their sweet home.  
几年前，罗言一家的回乡之旅还是漫长而劳顿的。如今有了高铁，回趟家就方便多了。五个小时的旅途，三人兴高采烈地聊着天，心中想的全是甜蜜的家。  

On their arrival, they find Luo’s parents eagerly waiting for them. Their home has been specially decorated for the joyous occasion. From the neat designs of the paper-cuttings on the windows, to the Spring Festival couplets on the door, and to the New Year paintings on the wall, everything represents joy, luck and happiness. Even the fish on the plate expresses a hope for nian nian you yu—yu means both “fish” and “plenty” in Chinese—“May you get more than you wish for every year”.  
刚到家，他们就发现父母早就翘首以待了。家中已经为这个喜庆的场合特别布置了一番。从窗上贴得整整齐齐的剪纸，到门上的春联，再到墙上的年画，无不象征着欢乐、吉祥和幸福。就连盘中的那条鱼也表达了对年 年 有 余 的 企 盼——在 汉 语 中“鱼”“余”谐音——祝愿每年的收获都能多于期望。  

After dinner, the hours until midnight go slowly by. The whole family are going to stay up late on the Chinese New Year’s Eve. They gather around the television to watch the Spring Festival Gala, while eating snacks, chatting with each other and making dumplings that they will eat at the very start of the new year. In the warmth and comfort of the room, Luo Yan talks about his plan for the future. “I hope we won’t have to be separated again,” he says, looking at his ageing parents. “My parents are getting old, and we should spend more time with them. We’ll come back more frequently and we’re also considering taking them to the city to live with us. After all, home is where all family members are together.”  
年夜饭后到午夜前的这几个小时缓慢地流淌着。除夕之夜，一家人都要熬夜守岁。他们围坐在电视机前看春节联欢晚会，一边吃着零食，聊着天，一边包着新年伊始要吃的饺子。在温暖舒适的房间中，罗言讲了他未来的打算。“我希望我们不用再分开了，”他看着年迈的父母，“我爸妈年纪大了，我们应该多陪陪他们。我们会回家回得更勤一点，也考虑着把二老接到城里，跟我们一起生活。不管怎么说，一家人在哪，哪就是家。”  

As midnight approaches, Luo Yan takes his parents, wife and son outside to set off firecrackers. The whole village is lit up with colourful fireworks. All over the country, people are celebrating their good fortune, celebrating their family’s togetherness, and celebrating their nation’s strength.  
午夜将至，罗言带着父母妻儿到屋外放鞭炮。五颜六色的烟花把整个村子都照亮了。举国上下，人们都在庆祝自己的好福气，庆祝合家团聚，庆祝祖国富强。

**The wonder of literature 文学的奇妙之处**  

A child and a man were walking on the beach when the child found a shell and held it to his ear. Suddenly he heard strange, low, musical sounds. These sounds seemed to be from another world and the child listened to them with wonder. Then the man explained that the child heard nothing strange, and that the shell caught a range of sounds too faint for human ears. What amazed the child was not a new world, but the unnoticed music of the old.  
孩子和男人在海滩上散步，孩子发现了一枚贝壳，把它放到了耳边。突然，他听到了奇怪、低沉、悦耳的声音。这声音仿佛来自另一个世界，孩子听后十分惊奇。随后那个男人解释说，孩子听到的声音没有什么奇怪的，只不过是贝壳捕捉到了种种对于人的耳朵来说过于微弱的声音而已。让孩子为之惊奇的其实不是一个新世界，而是旧世界那被人忽视的乐音。  

Some such experience as this lies in store for us when we begin the study of literature. Let a little song appeal to the ear, or a great book to the heart, and we discover a new world, a world of dreams and magic. To enter and enjoy this new world, we need to love literature, and make an effort to explain it. Behind every book is a man, behind the man is the race, and behind the race are the natural and social environments. We must know all these, if the book is to speak its whole message. In a word, we have now reached a point where we wish to enjoy and understand literature. The first step is to determine some of its significant qualities.  
当我们开始学习文学的时候，我们也会有如此这般的体验。让一首小曲愉悦我们的耳朵，或者让一部巨著触动我们的心灵，这样我们就会发现一个全新的世界，一个充满梦想和魔力的世界。要进入这个新世界，并享受其中的乐趣，我们需要热爱文学，并尽力去解读它。每本书背后都有一个人，此人身后是一个族群，这个族群背后是自然和社会环境。如果要了解一本书所传递的全部信息，我们就必须要了解所有这些内容。总之，我们现在已经到了想要欣赏和理解文学的阶段。第一步是确定它的一些重要特质。  

The first quality of literature is its description of truth and beauty, Some truth and beauty remain unnoticed until a sensitive human soul brings them to our attention, just as the shell reflects the unnoticed sounds. A hundred men may pass a field and see only dead grass; but a poet stops, looks deeper, sees truth and beauty, and writes, “Yesterday’s flowers am I.” One who reads it is capable of seeing the beauty that was hidden from his eyes before.  
文学的第一个特质是它对真与美的描写。一些真与美一直被忽视，直到一个敏锐的人类灵魂让它们引起我们的注意，正如贝壳捕捉到了我们未曾注意的声音一样。一百个人走过田野，眼中所见的可能都只是枯草，而诗人驻足，看得更深，他看到了真与美，遂写下：“昨日之花即是我。”读了这句诗的人便能看到以前隐匿在眼前的美。  

The second quality of literature is its appeal to our feelings and imagination. Its attraction lies more in what it awakens in us than what it says. When Christopher Marlowe’s Doctor Faustus asks in the presence of Helen, “Was this the face that launched a thousand ships?” he opens a door through which our imagination enters a new world, a world of love, beauty and heroism.  
文学的第二个特质是在于它能打动我们的情感，启发我们的想象力。文学的魅力更多在于它唤起了我们什么，而不在于它说了什么。当克里斯托弗·马洛笔下的浮士德博士当着海伦的面问道：“这就是那张让上千艘战舰为之起航的面庞吗？”他便打开了一扇门，通过这扇门，我们的想象力进入了一个充满爱、美和英雄主义的新世界。  

The third quality of literature, coming out of the other two, is its permanence. To achieve this, it should contain two elements: universal interest and personal style. Good literature reflects the most basic of human nature—love and hate, joy and sadness, fear and hope. It also takes on a personal style—no writer can describe human life without reflecting his own life and experiences.  
文学的第三个特质是其持久的生命力，它源于前两个特质。要实现这一点，它须包含两个要素：广泛的关切和个人的风格。好的文学作品反映了人性最基本的内涵——爱与恨、喜与悲、恐惧与希望。它也带有个人风格——没有哪个作家能够在描写人类的生活时不反映其个人生活和经历。  

In summary, literature is the expression of life in forms of truth and beauty, the written record of man’s thoughts and feelings, and the history of the human soul.  
总之，文学以真和美的形式对生命的表达，是人类思想和感情的写照，是人类灵魂的历史。

**The old Man and the Sea（Excerpt)《老人与海》（节选）**  

Ernest Hemingway (1899-1961), an American writer of novels and short stories, is well thought of for his unique writing style. He is extremely good at describing the adventures of tough men who he believes “can be destroyed but not defeated”. The Old Man and the Sea, one of his most important novels, tells the story of a fisherman named Santiago. After coming in empty-handed for eighty-four days, Santiago attempts to catch a huge fish.  
欧内斯特·海明威（1899—1961），美国小说家、短篇小说作家，因其独特的写作风格而广受好评。他非常擅长描写硬汉们的冒险经历，他认为那些硬汉“可以被毁灭但不能被打败”。《老人与海》是他最重要的小说之一，讲述了一个名叫圣地亚哥的渔夫的故事。在两手空空八十四天后，圣地亚哥试图捕一条大鱼。  

The fish was coming in on his circle now calm and beautiful looking and only his great tail moving. The old man pulled on him all that he could to bring him closer. For just a moment the fish turned a little on his side. Then he straightened himself and began another circle.  
这条鱼正打着转靠近，既冷静又美丽，只有它的大尾巴在动。老人用尽全力拉住它，想把它拉近些。有那么一小会儿，鱼稍稍偏向一边。接着它正了正身子，又开始转圈。  

“I moved him,” the old man said. “I moved him then.”  
“我拉动它了，”老人说，“我刚才拉动它了。”  

He felt faint again now but he held on the great fish all the strain that he could. I moved him, he thought. Maybe this time I can get him over. Pull, hands, he thought. Hold up, legs. Last for me, head. Last for me. You never went. This time I’ll pull him over.  
现在他又感到头晕了，但他竭尽全力拽住这条大鱼。我拉动它了，他想。也许这次我能搞定它。使劲拉呀，手啊，他想。站稳啦，腿啊。给我撑住，脑袋啊，给我撑住。你从未晕倒过。这次我要把它拉过来。  

But when he put all of his effort on, starting it well out before the fish came alongside and pulling with all his strength, the fish pulled part way over and then righted himself and swam away.  
可是当他使出浑身力气，在鱼靠近之前就开始用尽全力拉线时，那鱼中途就挣扎着偏向一边，然后正正身子游走了。  

“Fish,” the old man said. “Fish, you are going to have to die anyway. Do you have to kill me too?”  
“鱼啊，”老人说，“鱼啊，反正你都得死。你非要把我也杀了吗？”  

That way nothing is accomplished, he thought. His mouth was too dry to speak but he could not reach for the water now. I must get him alongside this time, he thought. I am not good for many more turns. Yes you are, he told himself. You’re good for ever.  
这样下去要一无所获了，他想。他的嘴干得说不出话来，但他现在不能伸手去拿水喝。我这次一定要把它拉到船边，他想。它再多转几圈，我就不行了。不，你行，他告诉自己。你永远都行。  

On the next tum, he nearly had him. But again the fish righted himself and swam slowly away.  
在接下来的一圈，他差点就把它拉过来了。但是这鱼又正了正身子，慢慢游走了。  

You are killing me, fish, the old man thought. But you have a right to. Never have I seen a greater, or more beautiful, or a calmer or more noble thing than you, brother. Come on and kill me. I do not care who kills who.  
你快弄死我了，鱼啊，老人想。不过你有权这么做。我从没见过比你更巨大、更美丽、更冷静或者更高贵的东西，老兄。来，杀了我吧。我不在乎谁弄死谁。  

Now you are getting confused in the head, he thought. You must keep your head clear. Keep your head clear and know how to suffer like a man. Or a fish, he thought.  
你现在脑子开始犯糊涂了，他想。你必须保持头脑清醒。保持头脑清醒，要像条汉子，懂得怎么受苦。或者像条鱼，他想。  

“Clear up, head,” he said in a voice he could hardly hear. “Clear up.”  
“清醒起来，脑袋，”他用自己都几乎听不见的声音说，“清醒起来。”  

Twice more it was the same on the turns.  
那鱼跟之前一样，又转了两圈。  

I do not know, the old man thought. He had been on the point of feeling himself go each time. I do not know. But I will try it once more.  
我不明白，老人想。每次他都觉得自己就快要不行了。我不明白。但我还要再试一次。  

He tried it once more and he felt himself going when he turned the fish. The fish righted himself and swam off again slowly with the great tail weaving in the air.  
我不明白，老人想。每次他都觉得自己就快要不行了。我不明白。但我还要再试一次。  

I’ll try it again, the old man promised, although his hands were mushy now and he could only see well in flashes.  
我要再试一下，老人答应自己，尽管他的双手这时已经软弱无力，而且大部分时间都看不清。  

He tried it again and it was the same. So he thought, and he felt himself going before he started; I will try it once again.  
他又试了一次，依然如故。还没动手他就感觉要不行了，他这样想，我还要再试一次。

**The Amazon rainforest: a natural treasure 亚马逊雨林：自然宝藏**  

Welcome to the jungle, a huge sea of green alive with the sounds of animals. This is the Amazon rainforest. As the largest rainforest in the world, it plays a significant role in maintaining the fine balance of the Earth’s ecosystem.  
欢迎来到丛林，这是一片绿色的海洋，处处可闻各种动物的声音。这里是亚马逊雨林。作为世界上最大的雨林，它在维系地球生态系统的微妙平衡上扮演着举足轻重的角色。  

The Amazon rainforest crosses into eight countries, including Brazil and Peru, and one overseas region of France, all on the South American continent. With an area of around 6 million square kilometres , the Amazon rainforest is more than half the size of China. The Amazon River, from which the rainforest gets its name, is close to 6,400 kilometres in length—roughly 100 kilometres longer than the Yangtze River. On its journey from the mountains to the ocean, the river supports many different ecosystems. They give this area the richest biodiversity on the Earth: one in ten known species in the world can be found here.  
亚马逊雨林穿过包括巴西、秘鲁在内的八个国家，以及一块法国的海外领地，都位于南美洲大陆。亚马逊雨林的面积约为600万平方千米，比中国国土面积的一半还要大。亚马逊雨林得名于亚马逊河，亚马逊河长约6,400千米，比长江还长大约100千米。这条河从高山流向海洋，沿途维系着多种不同的生态系统。它们赋予这片区域地球上最丰富的生物多样性：全世界十分之一的已知物种，都可以在这里找到。  

Of the 390,000 plant species known to us, more than 40,000 can be found in the Amazon. This tall and ancient brazil nut tree produces nuts that we can eat; these water lilies are big enough to lie down on. The forest’s different levels support an unbelievable variety of wildlife. At the bottom, there is a system of roots beneath the ground. Above that is the mass of leaf litter on the dark forest floor. The next level is made up of shorter plants with large leaves. Then there are the towering ancient hardwoods, and finally the tops of the tallest trees many metres above the ground. Each level of the forest forms its own little world, home to different kinds of living things.  
在人类已知的390,000种植物物种中，在亚马逊可以找到40,000多种。这棵高大、古老的巴西坚果树结出的坚果我们可以食用；这些睡莲（叶片）大到可以躺在上面。雨林的不同层次养活的野生动物种类多到难以置信。最底层是地下的根系。往上是阴暗森林地表厚实的落叶层。再往上一层由低矮的阔叶植物组成。然后是高耸、古老的阔叶树，最后是那些离地数米之高的大树的树冠。雨林的每一层都自成一个小世界，成为各种生物的家园。  

More than 1,300 species of birds and over 400 species of mammals hide among the jungle’s plant life. This jaguar is one example. It has a yellowish-brown coat with black spots. While a significant number of jaguars survive here, they are only one on at least 87 species, including frogs. These frogs, in turn, feed on insects which eat leaves and fruit. When a jaguar dies, a tiny army of microorganisms helps break down its body and return the nutrients to the earth.  
1,300多种鸟和400多种哺乳动物藏身于这片丛林的植被中。这只美洲豹就是个例子。它黄棕色的皮毛上遍布着黑点。尽管这里生存着数量可观的美洲豹，但它们仅仅是雨林食物链上的一环。它们捕食的物种至少有87种，其中包括青蛙.相应地，这些青蛙的食物，是以树叶和水果为食的昆虫。美洲豹死后，一小支微生物军队会助力其尸体的分解，让营养素重回土壤之中。  

The Amazon rainforest breathes life into the planet by fixing carbon and producing over 20 per cent of all the Earth’s oxygen. Thus, it is often known as the “lungs of the planet”. Moreover, the Amazon rainforest is a treasure house of species that can be used for food or medicine. Yet there is one major danger to these irreplaceable plants and animals: us. Over the past 50 years, about 17 per cent of the rainforest has disappeared due to human activities such as agriculture and cattie farming. As the impact of human activities continues to grow and the list of species in danger of extinction becomes longer, we are left with a question: can we afford to damage the “lungs of the planet”？  
亚马逊雨林通过固定碳，并生成占全球总量20%以上的氧气，来为地球注入活力。因此，它也常常被称作“地球之肺”。此外，亚马逊雨林还是食用物种和药用物种的宝库。然而，这些无可取代的动植物面临的一个主要威胁就是：我们。在过去的50年里，由于农耕和养牛等人类活动，17%的雨林已经消失了。随着人类活动影响的不断增加，濒危物种的名单越来越长，这留给我们一个问题：我们能承担得起损害“地球之肺”的后果吗？

**News that Matters: pollution in Norgate《焦点新闻》：诺盖特市的污染**  

**HOST:** Good evening and welcome to News that Matters. Our topic today is pollution in Norgate. Joining us in the studio tonight are James Smith, a local resident; Vincent Brown, senior manager of a local factory; and Julie Archer, chief of the Norgate Environmental Protection Committee. Welcome. Norgate’s rapid development has had significant environmental costs. Mr Smith, you’ve lived in this city for over 20 years. How would you describe the effects of pollution over that time?  
**主持人:** 晚上好，欢迎收看《焦点新闻》。我们今天的话题是诺盖特市的污染。今晚来到我们演播室的有本地居民詹姆斯·史密斯、本地一家工厂的高管文森特·布朗，还有诺盖特环境保护委员会的负责人朱莉·阿彻。欢迎你们。诺盖特市的高速发展付出了高昂的环境代价。史密斯先生，您已经在这座城市生活了二十多年。您能说说这二十年间污染造成的影响吗？  

**SMITH:** It’s been awful, really. When I first moved here, the air was fresh, the grass green and the water clear. Then heavy industry factories moved in, and things became entirely different. I don’t enjoy outdoor activities any more. The river is dirty and smelly. The smog in the air has coloured the sky a smoky grey; it’s also given me a cough that I can’t get rid of. For health and safety reasons alone, heavy industry has to go.  
**史密斯:** 非常糟糕，真的。我刚搬来时，这里空气清新、草绿水清。后来重工业工厂迁来了，情况变得截然不同了。我再也不喜欢户外活动了。河水又脏又臭。空气中的烟雾把天空都染成了烟灰色；这还让我患上了咳嗽，久治不愈。单是出于健康和安全的原因，重工业也必须迁走。  

**HOST:** Mr Smith protested against heavy industry. Mr Brown, would you like to respond?  
**主持人:** 史密斯先生反对重工业。布朗先生，您想做出回应吗？  

**BROWN:** Well, I’m sorry you feel that way, Mr Smith. People tend to connect factories with pictures of clouds of dirty smoke and irresponsible businessmen eager to make huge profits. In defence of the factories, however, I’d like to point out that we also try to control the amount of pollution we produce. I think I speak for all factory managers when I say we’re deeply concerned about the environment. We’ve been taking various measures, including the use of new technologies, to reduce pollution in the production process, even though these measures raise our production costs. I’d also like to draw your attention to the economic benefits factories have brought to Norgate. We’ve created many jobs for local residents and helped the city’s economy grow.  
**布朗：** 好吧，对于您那样的感受我很抱歉，史密斯先生。一提到工厂，人们总是将其与浓烟滚滚的画面和急于牟取暴利、不负责任的商人形象联系在一起。不过，我要为工厂说句话，我想指出，我们也在努力控制我们制造的污染。我们对环境问题深感担忧，我想，我是代表所有的工厂负责人说的这句话。我们一直在采取各种各样的措施，包括新科技手段的运用，来减少生产过程中产生的污染，尽管这些措施会增加我们的生产成本。我还希望您能注意到，这些工厂给诺盖特市带来的经济效益。我们为当地居民创造了许多就业岗位，并对这座城市的经济增长起到了助推作用。  

**HOST:** Thank you, Mr Brown. With pollution levels on the rise, the Norgate Environmental Protection Committee is searching for ways to fight the problem. Mrs Archer, what are your thoughts on how to deal with pollution?  
**主持人:** 谢谢您，布朗先生。鉴于污染程度不断加重，诺盖特环境保护委员会正在设法应对这个问题。阿彻女士，您对如何处理污染问题有何见解？  

**ARCHER:** Well, our committee has a major role to play in maintaining air and water quality. We have to achieve a balance between environmental protection and economic development. We’ve made environmental policies for businesses to observe, like strict clean-up requirements. We also work hand in hand with other branches of government to ensure that development strategies are followed in an environmentally friendly way. However, fighting pollution isn’t just a task for factories and the government. It has to be a community-wide effort, and everyone can help by following the golden rule: reduce, reuse and recycle. For example, you can save energy by taking the bus or the subway, or using the bike-sharing system.  
**阿彻：** 是的，我们委员会在维护空气质量和水质量方面发挥着重要作用。我们必须在环境保护与经济发展之间求得平衡。我们已经制定了供各行业遵守的环境政策，比如严格的净化要求。我们也与其他政府部门携手，确保以一种环境友好的方式贯彻发展战略。然而，与污染作斗争不仅仅是工厂与政府的任务，应该全社会通力协作，人人都可以通过遵守“减少使用、重复使用、回收利用”这一黄金法则来助力。打个比方，您可以乘坐公交车、地铁，或者使用共享单车来节约能源。  

**HOST:** Thank you, Mrs Archer, and thanks again to all of our guests. A former UN official once said, “Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth ... these are one and the same fight.” The fortunes of our environment and our economy are inseparable. It’s our duty to protect the environment while we aim for economic development. It’s our duty to leave a better, cleaner and healthier planet to our children. It’s our duty to build a human community with a shared future.  
**主持人:** 谢谢您，阿彻女士，再次感谢我们所有的嘉宾。一位联合国前官员曾经说过：“拯救我们的地球，让人们摆脱贫困，实现经济增长……这是同一场战斗。”我们的环境与经济的命运休戚与共。在追求经济发展的同时保护环境，这是我们的责任。将一个更美好、更清洁、更健康的星球留给我们的后人，这是我们的责任。构建人类命运共同体，这是我们的责任。

**Pupils’ lives spared during Falmont earthquake学生在弗尔蒙特地震中幸免于难**  

By Raymond Tran  
18 March  

FALMONT—On 17 March, 476 students and 36 teachers at Falmont Primary School escaped an earthquake that hit the county at 2:27 p.m. Only 5 students suffered slight injuries, despite the current figures 200 injured in the disaster area at large.  
弗尔蒙特——3月 17日下午 2：27，一场地震袭击了弗尔蒙特县，弗尔蒙特小学 476名学生和 36名教师成功逃生。尽管目前整个灾区伤亡数据为 7 人死亡，200 多人受伤，（弗尔蒙特小学）却仅有 5名学生受轻伤。  

Alice Brown, head teacher at Falmont Primary School, was teaching when the floor began to shake. Her students’ reaction was quick and correct—they moved under their desks, head first, and held on to the legs of the desks. At the same time, Miss Brown quickly opened the classroom door, in case it became damaged during the shaking and could not open. There were loud crashes of glass breaking and things falling to the ground, but the students remained still and waited calmly and quietly.  
弗尔蒙特小学校长艾丽斯·布朗当时正在授课，突然地面开始晃动。她的学生们反应迅速正确——他们头朝里，钻到桌子下面，并紧紧抓住桌腿。与此同时，布朗女士立刻打开教室门，以防门在震动中损坏打不开。尽管玻璃破碎、 东西倒地发出阵阵巨响，但是学生们仍然一动不动，沉着安静地等待着。  

The moment the shaking stopped, Miss Brown sensed it was the best time for the class to make their escape. She signalled to her students to exit the classroom in an orderly line covering their heads with their hands. Within one minute and twenty seconds, the whole class went down the stairs and rushed to the playground. Soon students from other classes arrived too. After a roll call confirmed that all were safe and sound, they relaxed, laughing, crying and hugging each other.  
晃动一停止，布朗女士立即意识到这是全班逃生的最好时机。她示意学生们用双手护着头，排好队，有序离开教室。1分20秒内，全班下楼梯，跑到了操场上。很快，其他班的学生也赶到了。点名确认所有人都安然无恙后，大家才松了一口气，笑啊，哭啊，互相拥抱着。  

“We practise earthquake safety procedures twice a year,” said Miss Brown, “so the kids were calm enough to protect themselves during the earthquake.”  
“我们每年进行两次地震安全规程演练，”布朗女士说，“因此在地震时，孩子们都十分镇定，能够保护好自己。”  

**Girl saves 100 from tsunami 女孩从海啸中拯救100人**  

By Jessie Cable  
21 December  

NEWDALE—On 20 December, a series of huge waves caused by an undersea Earthquake raced across the ocean near Goldshore and left thousands dead. Goldshore Beach was the only local beach to survive the disaster without any loss of life. A 10-year-old girl, Sabrina Andron, helped around 100 people escape danger with her knowledge of tsunamis.  
纽代尔——12月20日，由海底地震引发的巨浪接连席卷了金海岸附近海域，造成数千人死亡。金海岸海滩是当地唯一一个在此次灾难中没有任何人员损失的海滩。一个10岁的女孩，萨布丽娜·安德龙，利用自己掌握的海啸知识帮助大约100人脱险。  

The day began like any other on Goldshore Beach. People were walking, running or simply sitting on the sandy beach, enjoying the warm sea air and the soft wind that brushed their hair. Sabrina was one of the happy tourists until she noticed something odd. “The water was like the bubbles on the top of a beer,” she later explained. “It wasn’t calm and it wasn’t going in and then out. It was just coming in and in and in.” Sabrina had just learnt about tsunamis in a Geography lesson. It immediately occurred to her that these were signs of an approaching tsunami.  
那天刚开始，金海岸海滩上与往常一样。人们在散步、晨跑，或者就是坐在沙滩上，享受着温暖的海边空气和拂过发际的微风。萨布丽娜是这群快乐游客中的一位，直到她察觉到一丝异样。“海水像啤酒表面的泡沫一样，”她后来解释说，“不平静，也没有潮来潮去。海水只是一个劲儿地涌过来，涌过来，再涌过来。”萨布丽娜刚在一节地理课上学习了有关海啸的知识。她立刻意识到这是海啸来临的前兆。  

Sabrina was frightened, but she soon kept her head. She warned her parents of the danger, though at first they just thought she was joking. However, Sabrina was certain that a terrible disaster was on its way and kept asking her parents to talk to a safety officer. To her great relief, the officer immediately realized the coming danger. The beach was rapidly cleared of people, just before the huge waves crashed into the coast.  
萨布丽娜吓坏了，不过她很快冷静下来。她提醒父母有危险，但一开始他们只当她是在开玩笑。不过，萨布丽娜确信，一场可怕的灾难正在逼近，于是便不停地让父母去和安全员谈一谈。使她大为宽慰的是，安全员立即意识到危险即将来临。就在巨浪拍岸的前一刻，海滩上的人迅速疏散一空。

**The Last Days of Pompeii (Excerpt) 庞贝城的末日（节选）**  

Edward Bulwer-Lytton (1803-1873) was a talented British writer who left his mark on the English language. His classic novel The Last Days of Pompeii imagines life in the ancient Roman city of Pompeii in the year 79, when Mount Vesuvius erupted. This terrible natural disaster destroyed Pompeii completely, but it also kept the ancient city as it was for future ages. Since 1748, Pompeii has been systematically unearthed. Today it is an international tourist destination.  
爱德华·布尔沃-利顿（1803—1873）是一位才华横溢的英国作家，对英语语言产生了深远的影响。在其经典小说《庞贝城的末日》中，他对公元 79年维苏威火山爆发时，古罗马城市庞贝的生活场景展开了想象。这场骇人天灾将庞贝城彻底摧毁，却又为后世保存了这座古城的原貌。从 1748 年起，庞贝城开始得到系统发掘。如今这里已成为国际旅游胜地。  

Pompeii was a typical Roman city. In its little shops, its tiny palaces, its forum, its wine bars, its theatre—in the energy and skill of its people, you saw a model of the whole Roman Empire. Trading ships bringing imports to the city or carrying exports overseas, along with golden pleasure boats for the rich, were crowded together in the glassy water of the port. The boats of the fishermen moved rapidly in all directions. Above all, the cloud-capped top of Mount Vesuvius appeared. Its ashy rocks, now dark, now light, told a story of past eruptions that might have warned the city what was to come!  
庞贝是一座典型的罗马城市。从它的一个个小商铺、一座座小殿宇、广场、酒馆、剧场中——从庞贝人的活力和技艺中，你能看到整个古罗马帝国的缩影。进口货物到城内，出口货物到海外的商船，以及富贵人家金灿灿的游船，齐聚在港口波光粼粼的水面上。条条渔船向着四面八方疾行。在这一切的上方，云雾笼罩的维苏威火山山顶若隐若现。火山岩忽明忽暗，讲述着几度喷发的往事，这原本可以警告这座城市里的人们，即将到来的是什么！  

The awful night rolled slowly away, and the dawn greyly broke on THE LAST DAY OF POMPEII! The crowd looked upwards, and saw, with unspeakable fear, a huge cloud shooting from the top of the volcano. It took the form of a huge tree: the trunk, blackness, the branches, fire! This fire moved and changed in colour with every moment: now it was wildly bright, now of a pale and dying red, and now again it burnt with an unbearable light!  
可怕的夜晚缓缓退去，晦暗的晨光开启了庞贝城的末日！人们抬头仰望，眼前景象让他们感到莫名恐惧，只见一团庞大的云正从火山口喷薄而出。它形似一株巨树：树干，黑魆魆的；枝叶，那是火！火焰翻腾着，颜色变幻不定，时而极明亮，时而又变得微弱，呈现熄灭之前的暗红，时而又烧起来，放出刺眼的强光！  

The cries of women broke out; the men looked at each other, but were silent. At that moment, they felt the earth shaking beneath their feet; beyond in the distance, they heard the crash of falling roofs. A moment later, the mountain-cloud seemed to roll towards them, dark and rapid, like a river, at the same time, it threw out a shower of ashes and huge pieces of burning stone! Over the empty streets—over the forum—far and wide—with many a noisy crash in the stormy sea—fell that awful shower!  
女人们开始尖叫；男人们面面相觑，却都一言不发。那一刻，他们感到脚下的大地正在颤抖；他们听到远处有屋顶坍塌的巨响。过了片刻，山上的云团似乎正向他们滚滚而来，阴沉迅猛，如汹涌的江水；与此同时，云团中抛洒下阵雨似的火山灰和大块大块燃烧着的石头，落在空荡荡的街道，落在广场上，四面八方，还有许多掉在波涛汹涌的大海里，发出阵阵巨响——下了一场可怕的大雨！  

Each turned to fly—each running, pressing, pushing against the other. If, in the darkness, wife was separated from husband, or parent from child, there was no hope of their meeting again. Each hurried blindly and fearfully on. So came the earthquake... and so ended life in Pompeii.  
所有人都赶忙飞奔——他们奔跑拥挤，你推我搡。黑暗中，一旦妻离子散，就绝不可能重逢了。每个人都惊慌失措地盲目奔逃。这时，地震来了……庞贝城的生活就此终结。  

Nearly seventeen centuries had rolled away before the city of Pompeii was dug from its silent resting place. Its walls were fresh as if painted yesterday; not a single colour changed on the rich pattern of its floors. In its forum, the half-finished columns seemed as if just left by the workman’s hand. Long after fire and ash came for the people of Pompeii, the remains of their beautiful city survive to remind us that human lives burn bright and short.  
时间流过了近十七个世纪，庞贝城终于从它寂静的长眠之地被发掘出来。它的墙壁依然新得像昨天刚刚刷完；地板上繁复的图案，一点都没有色。广场上，那些尚未完工的石柱看起来就像刚刚离开工匠之手。在大火和火山灰袭击庞贝人很久很久之后，他们美丽城市的遗迹得以留存下来，提醒我们人类的生命灿烂而短暂。

**The Internet: a world without frontiers互联网：无疆世界**  

The Internet has the power to connect people across the world to a single shared community. Billions of people in different parts of the world have joined it already, and obviously many more will follow. Even in the countryside, the Internet enables people to reach beyond their villages and get in touch with the outside world. We can achieve almost anything online—with access to the Internet come some truly life-changing advantages.  
互联网拥有将全世界的人互联成一个共享群体的能力。世界各地数十亿人已加入其中，而且显而易见，更多人会接踵而至。即便在乡下，互联网也能使人们超越自己的村庄与外界联络。我们在网上几乎无所不能，接入互联网带来了一些实实在在的、改变我们生活的好处。  

One of the greatest advantages of the Internet lies in the quick and easy access to a huge amount of information. To a certain extent, the world’s knowledge is all at our fingertips. With the click of a mouse or the touch of a button, it is possible to find out almost anything we care to know, from recipes to travel packages, from military affairs to learning resources. In the time it takes to find one book in the library, we can use a search engine to bring up millions of results. No wonder the Internet has now become the first place that the majority of people turn to for information.  
互联网的最大优势之一在于可以快速、方便地获取海量信息。从某种程度而言，动动手指，全世界的知识就能尽在掌握。点一下鼠标，或者按一下按钮，就有可能找到几乎所有我们想了解的一切，从烹饪食谱到旅游套餐，从军事事务到学习资源。在图书馆找一本书的工夫，我们就可以用搜索引擎让上百万的结果出现在屏幕上。难怪互联网现在已经成为大多数人获取信息的首选途径。  

The Internet has also made our lives unbelievably convenient, with all sorts of goods and services provided by electronic commerce, more commonly known as e-commerce. You can have food delivered to you using food delivery apps and sites. Gone are the days of searching shop after shop for the perfect pair of boots—you can compare styles and prices quickly and easily in the comfort of your living room. Why wait hopelessly for a taxi in the cold rain? lt is now simple and fast to order one with a taxi app. Sit back and relax indoors for a few warm minutes until the driver arrives. When you wish to go on holiday, you can make all your travel arrangements just in front of the computer. Forgot to carry cash? There is no need to worry—you can pay for almost everything on your smartphone.  
互联网通过电子商务——也就是通常所说的电商——提供应有尽有的商品和服务，给我们的生活带来了令人难以置信的便利。通过外卖程序和网站，你可以让人送餐上门。为了买一双理想的靴子，一家店接着一家店去找的日子已经一去不复返了，你可以舒舒服服地待在自家客厅里比较款式和价格，省时省力。为什么要在寒冷的雨中绝望地等待出租车呢？如今，在出租车程序上预约一辆，既简单又快捷。在温暖的室内惬意地坐上几分钟，只待司机到达。想要度假的话，你只要坐在电脑前，就能搞定所有的行程安排。忘了带现金？不用担心，几乎所有的费用你都可以通过智能手机来支付。  

Above all else, the Internet helps us establish and maintain social ties. With all sorts of communication software, physical distance no longer gets in the way. No matter where we are, we are able to keep in contact with loved ones, find long-lost friends and discover whole new communities who share our hobbies. An instant message, a group chat, a video call, a comment on an update—there are endless ways to share our views or let someone know we care about them.  
最重要的是，互联网帮助我们建立并维持社交联系。有了各种通信软件，现实距离已不再是阻碍。不管身在何处，我们都能与所爱之人保持联系，找到久违的朋友，发现兴趣相投的新群体。即时消息、群聊、视频通话、对更新的评论——有无数方法来分享我们的观点，或让别人知晓我们对他们的关心。  

However, while the Internet brings many valuable advantages, being connected has its problems. As with any great invention, we must be aware of these problems and be careful to use the Internet properly and responsibly. Only in this way can the Internet be a place of discovery, wonder and inspiration for everyone. It is truly a world without frontiers.  
然而，尽管互联网有诸多宝贵的优势，“互联”却也有其自身的问题。跟对待任何伟大的发明一样，我们必须意识到这些问题，并合理、负责任地谨慎使用互联网。唯有如此，互联网才能成为每个人的发现之地、奇妙之所、灵感之源，才能真正成为无疆世界。

**Smartphone: a smart choice? 智能手机：明智的选择？**  

I was a smartphone addict. My eyes were glued to the little screen whenever walked down the street, had dinner with friends or lay in bed at night. The first thing I did when I woke up in the morning was reach for my phone. I always asked for Wi-Fi connections when I went to a new restaurant or coffee shop. A dead battery in my smartphone would make me feel stressed. Sometimes I had the uncomfortable feeling that this little machine had taken up too much of my time, and that I could have done something more meaningful than just looking at a tiny screen all day. Sliding into the habit was easy, but it was difficult to quit the habit.  
我是个“智能手机控”。无论是走在大街上，还是同朋友吃饭，或者晚上躺在床上，我都目不转睛地盯着这块小小的屏幕。早晨醒来，我做的第一件事情就是伸手拿手机。每当我到一家新餐厅或者咖啡厅时，我都会要求连上它们的无线网。如果手机电量耗尽，会让我感到焦虑。有时候，我有种不安的感觉，这台小小的机器已经占用了我太多的时间，我本该做一些更有意义的事，而不是整天都盯着一块小小的屏幕。陷入这种习惯很容易，戒掉它却很难。  

Then the day came when I finally realized I had to make a change. Head down, eyes on my smartphone, I stepped into the road and a car shot past, nearly knocking me off my feet At that very moment, I made up my mind to spend a whole week without my smartphone.  
终于我意识到自己必须做出改变的那天到来了。（那天）我低着头，眼睛紧盯手机走到马路上，一辆车疾驰而我下定决心，过一周不碰手机的日子。  

The first day was the hardest. I was used to checking the news and my friends’ social media updates every few minutes, but now I did not know what to do with myself. I kept reaching for my pocket, for my smartphone that was not there. I felt lost and anxious, as if I had missed something of value. Very soon, time slowed down. The empty hours stretched out in front of me, and I felt disconnected from everyone and everything.  
第一天是最艰难的。我已经习惯了隔几分钟就翻翻新闻，浏览一下朋友们社交媒体的更新情况，可是现在，我有去掏那只并不在里面的手机。我感到迷惘、紧张，仿佛我丢失了什么宝贵的东西。很快，时间就慢了下来。空虚的时光在我面前拉长，我感觉和所有人、所有事都断了联系。  

It was scary at first. Then somehow I began to feel free. The things that I had time for! I finally picked up the classic novel I had always wanted to read and was soon lost in the beautiful language. I kept a journal of my feelings, thoughts and daily activities to see how much progress I was making. I went out for a run and felt more alive than I had in days. The details of the scene were revealed in front of me: the soft sunlight, a bird singing from a high tree branch, the rich and earthy smell of the soil after the rain. Best of all, I began to appreciate the beauty in life with my own eyes, instead of through my smartphone camera.  
一开始很恐慌。然后不知怎的我开始感受到自由。我有时间可以做些事了！我终于重拾那本我一直都想读的名著小说，很快就沉浸在它优美的语言中。我用日记记录自己的感受、思绪和日常活动，看看自己都取得了多大的进步。我出门跑步，感觉自己比前几天要更有活力。风景的细微之处在我面前一览无余：和煦的阳光，一只小鸟在高高的树枝上歌唱，还有雨后浓郁的泥土的芬芳。最棒的是，我开始通过自己的双眼，而不是手机的摄像头，来欣赏生活中的美。  

My offline relationships benefited as well. I went for a long walk with an old friend. Our wide ranging conversation went so much deeper than brief texts ever could. With eyes no longer fixed on our phones, we had a chance to really enjoy each other’s company. I also made sure to spend more time with my parents. We went to the opera, played badminton, and visited museums. One night, my mother took out some family photos and we laughed about old times. I brought them up to date with what was going on in my life. We had never felt closer to each other.  
我的线下人际关系也受益良多。我和一位老友散了很长时间的步。我们话题广泛的交谈比简短的信息沟通要深刻得多。眼睛不再盯着手机，我们得以真正享受彼此的陪伴。我也确保留出更多的时间和父母一起度过。我们去看了歌剧，打了羽毛球，参观了博物馆。有天晚上，我妈拿出了几张家庭合影，回忆往昔，我们开怀大笑。我也让他们知悉最近我生活中发生了哪些事。我们觉得彼此从未如此亲密过。  

By the end of the week, I almost did not want to turn my phone back on. Those seven days have given me a great appreciation for life beyond the screen. Real life—and real relationships—are more important to me now. I cannot escape from the modern world, but I can cut back on the amount of time I spend on my smartphone every day, and I do. Life beyond smartphones is richer and more beautiful, and I am going to take advantage of it.  
那周快结束时，我几乎不想再打开手机了。这七天的经历让我得以好好享受屏幕之外的生活。现在，真实的生活和真实的人际关系对我来说更为重要。我无法逃离现代世界，但我可以减少每天花在手机上的时间，我说到做到。智能手机以外的生活更丰富也更美妙，我要善加利用。

**Chinese scientist wins 2015 Nobel Prize中国科学家赢得2015诺贝尔奖**  

By Dina Conner  
11 December 2015  

Tu Youyou has become the first female scientist of the Peoples Republic of China to receive a Nobel Prize, awarded for her contribution to the fight against malaria, one of the deadliest diseases in human history. Thanks to her discovery of qinghaosu, malaria patients all over the world now have had a greatly increased chance of survival.  
屠呦呦成为中华人民共和国首位获得诺贝尔奖的女科学家。她获奖是因为她为抗击疟疾所做出的贡献——疟疾是人类历史上最致命的疾病之一。得益于她发现的青蒿素，如今全世界疟疾患者的存活率大大提高。  

Born in 1930, in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, Tu studied medicine at university in Beijing between 1951 and 1955. After graduation, she worked at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine. She completed further training courses in traditional Chinese medicine, acquiring a broad knowledge of both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine.  
1930年，屠呦呦出生于浙江宁波。1951年至1955年，屠呦呦在北京读大学，学习药学。毕业后，她在中医研究院工作。她完成了中医领域的培训课程深造，获得了广泛的中西医知识。  

Tu’s education was soon to prove very useful. In the 1960s, many people were dying of malaria, and in 1969 Tu became head of a team that intended to find a cure for the disease. She collected over 2,000 traditional Chinese medical recipes for malaria treatment and made hundreds of extracts from different herbs. When they failed to produce any promising results, Tu referred to the ancient books of traditional Chinese medicine again.  
屠呦呦接受的教育很快被证明非常有用。20世纪60年代，许多人死于疟疾，于是1969年屠呦呦担任了一个旨在找到疟疾疗法的小组的组长。她收集了2,000多种治疗疟疾的中药配方，并从不同的草药中获取了数百种提取物。当这些未能取得任何有希望的效果时，屠呦呦就再次查阅中医典籍。  

Inspired by an over 1,600-year-old text about preparing qinghao extract with cold water, Tu redesigned the experiments and tried extracting the herb at a low temperature in order not to damage its effective part. On 4 October 1971, after 190 failures, she succeeded in making qinghao extract that could treat malaria in mice.  
在一本1,600多年前的典籍中，关于用冷水制备青蒿提取物的记载给了屠呦呦启发，她重新设计了试验，并尝试在低温下对这种草药进行提取，以不损害其有效成分。1971年10月4日，在历经190次失败之后，她成功制备出可以治疗老鼠疟疾的青蒿提取物。  

However, it was hard to produce enough qinghao extract for large trials because research resources were limited. Tu and her team managed to find solutions to the problem. When there was no research equipment, they had to extract herbs using household water containers. They worked day and night and their health began to suffer because of the poor conditions, but they never gave up.  
然而，由于研究资源有限，很难制造出足够的青蒿提取物用于大规模试验。屠呦呦团队成功找到了解决这个问题的方法。当时没有研究设备，他们只好用家用储水的容器来提取草药。他们夜以继日地工作，由于条件恶劣，他们的健康开始受损，但却从未放弃。  

Even with large amounts of qinghao extract produced, however, they still faced another problem. The trials on patients were likely to be postponed because they did not have sufficient safety data. To speed up the process and ensure its safety, Tu and her team volunteered to test qinghao extract on themselves first.  
然而，即使制造了大量的青蒿提取物，他们仍然面临着另外一个问题。由于没有足够的安全数据，对患者的试验可能会推迟。为了加快进度并保证其安全性，屠呦呦和她的团队自愿先在他们自己身上试验青蒿提取物。  

The efforts of Tu and her team finally paid off. In November 1972, through trial and error, they successfully discovered qinghaosu—the most effective part of the qinghao extract. As a key part of many malaria medicines, qinghaosu has since benefited about 200 million malaria patients. More than 40 years after its discovery, Tu was eventually awarded a Nobel Prize for her work. In her Nobel Lecture, she encouraged scientists to further explore the treasure house of traditional Chinese medicine and raise it to a higher level. Perhaps the next generation of scientists, drawing on the wisdom of traditional Chinese medicine, will indeed discover more medicines beneficial to global health care.  
屠呦呦团队的努力最终得到了回报。1972年11月，经过反复试验，他们成功发现了青蒿素——青蒿提取物中最有效的成分。作为许多抗疟药物中的关键成分，青蒿素迄今已经造福了近2亿疟疾患者。在发现青蒿素40多年后，屠呦呦终于因此获得了诺贝尔奖。在她的获奖演讲上，屠呦呦鼓励科学家们进一步探索中医这座宝库，并让其更上一层楼。也许新一代的科学家汲取中医的智慧，确实能发现更多有益于全世界医疗的药物。

**The Value of Science**  

When I was younger, I thought science would make good things for everybody. It was obviously useful; it was good. But then during the war I worked on the atomic bomb. This result of science was obviously very serious—it represented the destruction of people and it put our future at risk. I had to ask myself, “Is there some evil involved in science?”  
在我还很年轻的时候，我以为科学会给每个人都带来好处。科学显然是有用的；有好的一面。但随后在战争期间，我从事了原子弹的研究。这个科学的成果又明摆着有很大危险性——它意味着人的毁灭，并使我们的未来岌岌可危。我不得不扪心自问：“科学之中是不是也包含罪恶？”  

Put another way, what is the value of the science | had long devoted myself to—the thing I had loved—when I saw what terrible things it could do? It was a question I had to answer. I thought long and hard about this question, and I will try to answer it in this talk.  
换言之，在我发现科学可能造成的恶果之后，我一直投身其中的科学，我曾经的挚爱，价值何在？这是一个我不得不回答的问题。关于这个问题，我苦思冥想了很久，我将试着在这次演讲中给出解答。  

The first way in which science is of value is familiar to everyone: scientific knowledge enables us to do and make all kinds of things. Of course, if we make good things, it is not only to the credit of science; it is also to the credit of the moral choice which led us to good work. Scientific knowledge is an enabling power to do either good or bad—but it does not carry instructions on how to apply it. Such power has obvious value—even though the power may be negated by what one does with it.  
科学体现价值的第一种方式对每个人而言都耳熟能详：科学知识让我们能够做各种各样的事，造不同种类的东西。当然，如果我们做了好事，不仅归功于科学，还归功于引导我们行善的道德选择。科学知识是一种让我们可以行善也可以作恶的力量——但是该如何运用，它并未自带说明书。这样的力量其价值显而易见，尽管，这力量会被某人用它所做的事否定。  

Another value of science is the intellectual enjoyment it can provide us with. When we look at any question deeply enough, we feel the excitement and mystery coming to us again and again. With more knowledge comes a deeper, more wonderful mystery, inspiring one to look deeper still. Never concerned that the answer may let us down, with pleasure and confidence we turn over each new stone to find unimagined strangeness leading on to more wonderful questions and mysteries. Thanks to the scientific effort, we have been led to imagine all sorts of things more fantastic than poets and dreamers of the past ever could.  
科学的另一种价值在于它能够给予我们以智力的享受。当我们足够深入地探究某个问题时，我们会感到兴奋和神秘不断地扑面而来。随新知而来的是更深刻、更精妙的奥秘，激励我们更深入地去探究。我们从不担心答案会令人失望，带着愉悦和信心，我们翻开每一块新的石头去发现意想不到的奇妙，它们指向更多精妙的问题与奥秘。有赖于在科学付出的努力，我们在其引领下构想出形形色色的东西，远比过去任何一位诗人和梦想家的想象更加美妙。  

I would now like to turn to a third value that science has. The scientist has a lot of experience with ignorance and doubt and uncertainty, and this experience is of very great importance. When a scientist doesn’t know the answer to a problem, he is ignorant. When he has an idea as to what the result is, he is uncertain. And when he is pretty sure of what the result is going to be, he is still in some doubt.  
现在，我要说到科学的第三种价值。科学家经常会经历无知、怀疑和不确定，而这种经历非常重要。当科学家不知道某个问题的答案时，他是无知的。当他对于结果是什么有主意时，他是不确定的。当他非常确信结果将会怎样时，他仍旧有所怀疑。  

Now, we scientists take it for granted that it is perfectly possible to live and not know. But our freedom to doubt was born out of a deep and strong struggle against authority in the early days of science. In order to progress, we must not forget the importance of this struggle; we must recognize our ignorance and leave room for doubt. Permit us to question-to doubt-to not be sure. It is our responsibility as scientists, knowing the great progress that is the fruit of freedom of thought, to declare the value of this freedom; to teach how doubt is not to be feared but to be welcomed and discussed; and to demand this freedom as our duty to all coming generations.  
如今，我们科学家理所当然地认为，生而有所不知是完全有可能的。但是我们怀疑的自由，脱胎于早年间科学为对抗权威展开的深刻而强硬的斗争。为了进步，我们切不可忘记这场斗争的重要性；我们必须认识到自己的无知，并且为怀疑留出一席之地。要允许我们提问——怀疑——不确定。作为科学家我们深知伟大的进步是思想自由的成果，我们有责任阐明这种自由的价值；我们有责任教导人们怀疑不可怕，它值得欢迎和探讨；我们更有责任强烈要求这一自由，这就是我们对后世的义务。

## Unit 1 food matters  
Food keeps us healthy and energetic. It can also do more than that. The article below, from a food magazine, discusses the idea of comfort food. Before you read the article, think about the following questions:  
①What do you think the article will talk about according to the title?  
②What foods can have an impact on your feelings?  
食物使我们健康和精力旺盛。它也远不与此。下面来自一本食物杂志的文章讨论治愈系食物理念。在阅读文章之前，思考以下的问题：  
①根据标题，你认为文章将谈论什么？  
②什么食物对你的情感有影响？  

### Reading  
**comfort food（治愈系食物）**  

Whenever I feel lonely, I have a secret recipe that never fails: rice, milk and sugar, cooked low and slow. No matter how bad my mood is, that perfect combination is always enough to lift my spirits. Sometimes the smell alone can do the trick, not to mention the lovely creamy flavour, which works like a time machine immediately transporting me back to my sunny childhood. With pleasure, I remember the lazy Sunday afternoons I used to spend in the warmth of my grandma’s flat, listening to her wonderful stories and greedily eating bowl after bowl of her delicious rice pudding. I take my time over every spoonful, gently rolling the silky dessert around my mouth and enjoying the perfect marriage of rice and milk. Before I know it, I’m happy again.  
每当感到孤独，我都有一个屡试不爽的秘方：大米，牛奶和糖，小火慢炖。不论我情绪有多差，这种绝妙的组合都足以令我振作。有时候仅仅闻一闻味儿就能奏效，更不要说那美妙，滑腻的口感了。它像一台时光机器，立即将我带回欢乐的童年，欣欣然，我回忆起那些精彩的周末午后，那时我常常是在外婆温暖的公寓里，一边听她讲那些精彩的故事，一边一碗接一碗贪婪地吃着她做的美味的大米布丁。我细细品尝每一勺，让滑腻的甜点在我口中轻轻翻转，享受米糊和牛奶的完美融合。不知不觉中，我便又开心起来了。  

My experience with rice pudding illustrates the unique power of “comfort food”. In its broadest sense, comfort food refers to any food that makes us feel better. In this article, we will talk about a particular type of comfort food whose power mainly lies in the associations it calls to mind. It often makes up for bad feelings by helping us recall happy memories of the people, things or places we love.  
我关于大米布丁的经历说明了“治愈系食物”的独特力量。从广义上说，治愈系食物指的是任何能改善我们心情的食物。在本文里，我们要特别讲一类治愈系食物，它的力量主要在于它所唤起的联想。它常常通过帮助我们回忆起所爱之人、所爱之物、所爱之地的快乐往事，来消解不良情绪。  

Our comfort foods are highly individual. They vary from person to person, depending on our own unique experiences that have shaped our lives. If we grow up eating certain foods in our family, then those foods tend to be linked with positive emotions. For example, we often connect chicken soup with a happy childhood and its flavour becomes tied up with the feeling of being taken care of. When we eat it again, we unlock memories of a time when we were loved and looked after, and this cheers us up.  
治愈系食物相当个性化。它们由塑造我们人生的独特经历决定，因人而异。如果我们从小在家就吃某些特定的食物，这些食物就很容易与积极的情绪产生关联。比如，我们经常把鸡汤与快乐的童年联系在一起，它的味道与被关爱的感觉相关。当再次喝鸡汤时，我们解锁记忆，回想起受到疼爱与关怀的时光，这就会让我们的情绪变好。  

The feeling of happiness and sense of belonging can become particularly important for people who move away from their home country. According to some food experts, there are some aspects of culture that people will lose right away, but with food, there are more opportunities to connect to memory, family and place. It is hardest to give up the food that you grow up with. Of course, each person’s comfort food largely depends on where they come from—for a Chinese it might be a plate of dumplings with a saucer of vinegar, and for a native of the UK it might be the classic fish and chips, served hot, salty and sour. One mouthful of comfort food takes us back to our cultural roots, giving us the “taste of home” that we cry out for and relieving feelings of homesickness.  
这种幸福感与归属感对于离开故国的人而言会变得尤为重要。据一些食物专家所言，文化中的某些方面人们很快会失去，但对于食物，则有更多机会与回忆、与家、与处所关联。从小到大的食物最难割舍。当然，每个人的治愈系食物（是什么）很大程度上取决于他们来自何方 - - - 对一个中国人来说，可能是一盘饺子配上一碟醋；而对于一个土生土长的英国人来说，则可能是经典的炸鱼薯条，热腾腾地端上来，咸中带酸。一口治愈系食物带我们回到自己文化的根，带来我们渴望的“家的味道”，让我们一解怀乡之情。  

That’s certainly true for me. Comfort food tastes good and by building an emotional bond with our happy memories, always makes us feel good. It isn’t just a bowl of noodles or chicken soup. It’s food for the soul.  
对我而言，的确如此。治愈系食物味道可口，通过与我们快乐的回忆之间建立情感联系，它让我们心情不错。它不仅仅是一碗面条或鸡汤，它是心灵的食量。  

When we are in low spirits, we may cry out for things that give us comfort and a sense of security. Since it brings back happy memories of the past or offers an opportunity to connect with our home culture, comfort food can often do the trick . However, there is another type of comfort food, which generates positive emotions in a different way. Food high in calories may also make us feel better. As desserts like cakes are digested, blood sugar levels can go up quickly. As a result, we will be in a better mood after eating the comfort food. However, the sharp increase in blood sugar will cause the body to produce a special chemical to remove it. When the chemical lowers blood sugar levers, we are likely to feel sad again and will greedily eat more comfort food. There is then the danger of entering a cycle of highs and lows where more and more comfort food, high in carbohydrates, need to be eaten. This links with health problems like being overweight.  
当我们情绪低落时，我们可能急需要给我们安慰和安全感的东西。既然它能唤起我们对过去的美好回忆，或者提供一个与我们家乡文化联系的机会，治愈系食物通常就能起作用。但是，有另外一类治愈系食物，它以一种不同的方式产生积极的情感。富含卡洛里高的食物也使我们感觉更好，随着像蛋糕之类的甜点被消化，血糖会很快上升。结果，我们在吃了治愈系食物之后，情绪就会更高。但是，血糖急剧上升会使身体产生一种特别的化学物质来去除它。当化学物质降低血糖时，我们很可能会再次感到伤心，将会贪婪地吃更多的治愈系食物。然后就会进入血糖或高或低的恶性循环危险之中，就需要吃越来越多富含碳水化合物的治愈系食物。它与超重等问题有关。  

Comfort food is an important tool in helping us relieve tension and feel good about ourselves. However, be aware of the hidden dangers of high-calorie comfort food!  
治愈系食物在帮助我们缓解紧张和使自己感觉好方面是一个很重要的工具。但是，要意识到高卡路里治愈系食物的隐藏危险

**7 March,Sichuan hot pot 3月7日，四川火锅**  

The mouth-watering hot pots of Sichuan are as famous overseas as they are in China, and the hot flavour is enough to heat up a cold midwinter evening or to let loose rivers of sweat on a summer afternoon. I gave it my first try last night, together with a few local friends. As the soup bubbled slowly over a gas burner in the middle of the table, its surface was covered with a beautiful layer or chillies, Sichuan peppers, spring onions and red oil. Slowly at first, and then faster and faster, we tipped plates of fresh meat, fish and vegetables into the pot. The hot flavour quickened our laughter and conversation, making the meal the perfect way to relax with friends.  
令人垂涎欲滴的四川火锅，闻名海内外，那火锅的风味足以温暖隆冬的寒夜，或在夏日的午后让人汗流如注。昨晚，我第一次尝试了四川火锅，是与几位当地的朋友一道吃的。桌子正中的煤气炉上，汤缓缓地冒着泡，表面覆盖着一层辣椒，花椒和红油，甚是好看。我们把一盘盘新鲜的肉、鱼和 菠菜倒进锅里，一开始慢，到后来越来越快，热辣的味道让大家谈笑起来更有兴致，这顿饭成了与友人放松的最佳方式。  

Sichuan hot pots are perfect for the damp, foggy climate in which they were invented. They are believed to have started off in the late Qing Dynasty as a way for boatmen on the Yangtze River to keep warm during the cold and wet winters. In the beginning, the delicious dish was made simply by boiling vegetables, chillies and Sichuan peppers in water. Over time, it has expanded to include multiple options of soups, vegetables, meats and sauces, appealing to people of different tastes. What I love best about Sichuan hot pots is that they offer a great opportunity to socialize with friends since a meal can last for hours. I instantly became a big fan of Sichuan hot pots and I’ll soon be back for more!  
四川火锅非常适合其发源地潮湿多雾的气候。人们认为，火锅始自清末，当时是长江上的船工在湿冷的冬季取暖的一种方法。一开始，美味的火锅只不过是将菠菜、辣椒和花椒用水煮。后来，火锅的内容逐渐丰富，包括各式汤底以及品种多样的菠菜、肉和调料，满足了人们不同的口味。我最喜欢四川火锅的一点在于，它为朋友间的交往提供了很棒的机会，因为一顿饭能吃上好几个小时。我瞬间成了四川火锅的“铁杆粉丝”，我很快会再回来吃的。  

**12 August, Nanjing salted duck 8月12日，南京盐水鸭**  

Salted duck is Nanjing’s most famous food export. Several plain in thin, white slices, the meat is juicy and salty. Each Nanjing salted duck takes several days to prepare, and the process includes salting, drying, boiling and cooling. As I finished my first helping on a recent afternoon in Nanjing, my host, Chef Zhang, told me a little more about the dish.  
盐水鸭是南京最有名的特色食品。鸭肉简单地切成白白的薄片，多汁带咸。每只盐水鸭都要经过腌、晾、煮、凉等工序，耗费数天制成。前几天下午，我在南京吃完我第一份盐水鸭后，做东的张大厨给我介绍了一下这道菜。  

The countryside around Nanjing has been famous for its ducks for centuries; its countless waterways make the area perfect for raising waterbirds. A local history book from the late Qing Dynasty praised salted duck in particular, saying it was without equal. Traditionally, duck is considered to have cooling properties, so it is appropriate for the hot summer months. Nowadays, people eat salted duck all year round and it is estimated that tens of thousands of ducks are consumed every day in Nanjing! It definitely hit the spot when I tried it, and it has become one of my personal favourites.  
南京周边的乡村因为鸭子已经驰名中外数百年，这一带水网密布，非常适合养殖水禽。一本清末的地方志尤其盛赞盐水鸭，称其无与伦比。传统上鸭肉被认为性凉，所以适宜在炎热的夏季食用。如今，人们一年四季都吃盐水鸭，据估计南京人每天要吃掉数万只鸭子！我一尝，它正对我胃口，盐水鸭已经成了我最钟爱的美食之一。  

**8 December, Cantonese dim sum 12月8日，广东点心**  

In Guangzhou, morning tea is such an essential part of the daily routine that “Have you had your tea?” has become the local version of “Good morning.” Though teahouses have been common in China since the Tang Dynasty, the Cantonese innovation of the mid-19th century was to serve tea together with a variety of light dishes, or dim sum. The concept took off, and today Guangzhou’s restaurants stimulate customers’ appetite with over a thousand offerings, each more delicate and delicious than the last.  
在广东，早茶在日常生活中的地位是如此重要，以至于“饮茶未”（粤语，意为“你吃早茶了吗”- - -译者注）成了当地人问候早安的方式。虽说茶馆在中国从唐代开始司空见惯了，但19世纪中叶广东人的创新在于将茶佐以各种小菜或点心。这种观念时兴起来，如今广州的餐厅用一千多道点心刺激着食客的食欲，一道比一道精致，可口。  

The Cantonese do not hurry over their breakfast, as I found when I visited a restaurant in Guangzhou’s old city centre this morning, The emphasis is rather on conversation about business, family or pleasure, and locals can spend hours together chatting, drinking tea and working their way through the menu. From beef balls to rice noodle rolls, there are various dishes that have been baked, boiled, steamed or fried. A single visit is not enough to appreciate everything, and I have a long list of dim sum I still need to try.  
广东人用早餐并不匆忙，正如今天早晨我在广东老城区中心的一家餐厅所见的那样，重点是谈生意，话家常、说乐子。当地人可以花上几个小时一起谈天，饮茶，慢慢吃遍菜单上所有的点心。从牛丸到肥肠，烤、煮、蒸、炸的菜品各式各样，来一次不足以尝个遍，我列出了一个长长的清单，都是以后要品尝的点心。  

## Unit 2 The Universal language  

### Reading  
A great way to learn about a new culture is through its music. The emails below are written by two exchange students who are discovering new music in their host countries. Before you read the emails, think about the following questions:  
What information do you think the emails contain according to the subjects?  
Have you watched a music performance live or on TV? What was it like?  

**Understanding culture through music**  
**透过音乐理解文化**  

Hi Lucy,露丝：  

So glad to get your email. I hope everything is fine with you. Last night, I watched a performance of Butterfly Lovers, a beautiful violin concerto composed by He Zhanhao and Chen Gang. It’s a piece that really deserves to be heard.  
你好！很高兴收到你的电邮。希望你一切都好。昨晚吗，我观看了一场《梁祝》的演出，这是由何占豪、陈钢创作的一部动听的小提琴协奏曲，这部作品真的值得一听。  

The music took me through the twists and turns of a classic story about a young couple torn apart by their families. When the two lover, Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,first meet, the music tis light and pleasant, as if whispering to the audience. It is followed by a fast and cheerful section which represents their three happy years of school. Then the music gets dramatic with heavier notes and that is when the lovers are separated because Zhu’s father forces her to marry another man. Angry and sad, Liang falls sick and dies. Zhu weeps bitterly over the loss her love. Overcome with sorrow, she jumps into his grave. Finally, during the most exciting part, the music takes a softer turn and ends on a bittersweet note, telling us how the couple transform into butterflies and fly away to be together forever. It is an amazing journey!  
乐曲带我进入了一个跌宕起伏的经典故事，讲述的是一对年轻情侣被他们家庭拆散的遭遇。当两个相爱的人，梁山伯与祝英台初次相见时，音乐轻柔愉悦，像是在低声耳语。随后是欢快的一节，代表两人同窗三载的快乐时光。接下来，曲调突然变得沉重，此时这对情侣被拆散，因为祝英台的父亲逼她另嫁他人。梁山伯悲愤交加，染病而亡，祝英台为失挚爱而痛哭，不胜伤悲，她跳进了梁山伯的坟墓。最后，在最激昂的部分，乐曲转而柔缓，以凄美的曲调收尾，它告诉我们，这对情侣化蝶而去，永世不再分离，真是一段美妙的旅程！  

Butterfly Lovers combines Chinese and Western musical elements: it is played on Western instruments such as the violin, but more significantly, much of the music has its roots in Chinese Yue Opera. This unique combination has made me realize that music is indeed a universal language. You should definitely listen to Butterfly Lovers—I bet you’ll like it.  
《梁祝》融合了中西方的音乐元素，以西方乐器，譬如小提琴等演奏，但更重要的是，其曲调大多源自中国的越剧，这种独特的融合使我认识到，音乐的确使一种世界语言。你真该听一听《梁祝》- - - 我保证你一定会喜欢它！  

All the best,祝一切顺利！

Dear Stephen,亲爱的斯蒂芬：  

Life here in Nashville is as interesting as I thought it would be. My host family are big fans of country music, so I can always rely on them to introduce me to some great songs. I love learning about country music and I keep asking them questions about it all the time!  
在纳什维尔的生活和我之前料想得一样有趣。我（寄宿）的主人家是乡村音乐的“铁杆粉丝”，所以我一直相信他们能给我介绍一些很棒的歌曲，我喜欢了解乡村音乐，一直在请教他们关于乡村音乐的问题。  

It turns out that country music became popular right here in the south of America in the 1940s and then spread across the nation. It grew out of such music types as the blues and folk music, so the musicians use many similar instruments, such as the guitar. The tunes are easy to sing, and the lyrics often leave you deep in thought. Most of the songs are about hardship and heartbreak, but also about hope—with plenty of humour thrown in for good measure. You can feel an emotional connection between you and the musicians.  
原来，20世纪50年代乡村音乐正是在美国南部这里流行起来的。随后传遍整个美国。它源于诸如布鲁斯和民谣这样的音乐，所以音乐家们使用很多类似的乐器，比如吉他，乡村音乐的调子朗朗上口，歌词常常发人深省。大部分歌曲唱的是艰难与心碎，但也有希望---其中还附加了很多幽默元素，你可以感受到自己与音乐家之间的那种情感的联系。  

Country music shows the peaceful green fields and simple life of the countryside. Obviously I don’t know what it’s truly like to grow up in rural America, but the master of country music, like John Denver, can make you feel like you’re there. The simple tunes and beautiful natural images are often very suggestive of countryside surroundings:  
乡村音乐展现的是乡村静谧的绿野和质朴的生活。我显然不知道在美国乡村长大究竟是什么样子，但是乡村音乐的大师们，比如约翰 ·丹佛，能让你觉得身临其境，简单的曲调和唯美的大自然很容易使人联想到乡村的环境。  

> Almost heaven, West Virginia  
> Blue Ridge Mountains, Shenandoah River Life is old there, older than the trees  
> Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze  
> (From “Take Me Home, Country Roads” by John Denver)  

Why don’t you try to listen to some great country music? I guarantee you’ll enjoy it!  
西弗吉尼亚，简直就是天堂  
蓝岭山脉，谢南多厄河流  
那里生命古老，比数更年长  
又比群山年轻，像风一样生长  
(摘自约翰 ·丹佛《乡村路带我回家》你为什么不试试听几首很棒的乡村音乐？我保证你会喜欢的！  

Best wishes,致最美好的祝福，

Read the magazine article about the great classical musician Ludwig van Beethoven.  

**Beethoven: a remarkable life**  
**贝多芬:非凡的一生**  

On 7 May 1824, a crowd of music lovers streamed into a theatre in Vienna to hear the first-ever performance of the great Ludwig Van Beethoven’s Symphony No.9. The crowd immediately recognized that they were listening to something truly special, and they broke into enthusiastic cheers at the end of the symphony. Beethoven,who was almost completely deaf at this point in his life, was unaware of the audience’s response until one of the singers turned him around to face the crowd. Before him, he saw a sea of people all standing, clapping , and waving their hats and handkerchiefs to express their appreciation of his masterwork.  
1824年5月7日，一群音乐爱好者涌入维也纳的一座剧院，聆听大作曲家路德维希·凡·贝多芬《第九交响曲》的首演。听众很快意识到他们所听绝非凡品，演出结束的那一刻，全场爆发出热情的欢呼。当时贝多芬已近全聋，直到一位领唱扶他转过身来，面向观众，他才发觉反响之热烈。他看见眼前的人山人海全部起立，有的鼓掌，有的挥舞帽子和手帕，表达着对这部杰作的赞赏。  

Symphony No 9 was Beethoven’s last major piece of music in a vast body of works written throughout his remarkable life. As a gifted child, Beethoven was pushed by his father to study music day and night. Not long after, he began to be appreciated for his piano performances. By the time he was a teenager, he had already enjoyed a reputation as a wonderful young musician. Many important figures in the music world, including the brilliant musician Mozart, started making predictions about Beethoven’s extraordinary future. However, life took a sharp turn. In his late twenties, Beethoven suffered one of the worst possible twists for a musician: he started to lose his hearing.  
贝多芬非凡的一生留下了极为丰厚的作品，《第九交响曲》是他最后一部大型作品。贝多芬幼年即展露才华，在父亲管教下夜以继日地学习音乐。没过多久，他的钢琴演奏已受人赏识。十多岁的时候，他已经是有名的杰出少年音乐家了。不少音乐领域的重要人物，包括才华卓越的莫扎特，都纷纷对他不可限量的前程给出预言。然而，厄运突至，不到三十岁，贝多芬就开始经受音乐家来说至为残酷的挫折：他的听觉开始衰退了。  

The loss of his hearing deeply depressed Beethoven. He was so upset that, at first, he wanted to keep it a secret. In a letter to his brothers, he wrote, “......how could I possibly admit a weakness in the one sense which should be more perfect in me than in others, a sense which I once possessed in the greatest perfection...” Even in his darkest moments, however, Beethoven never abandoned hope. Despite his hearing loss, he was determined to find a way to continue living a life full of music. He used a variety of hearing aids to try to increase the amount of sound he could take in. When composing music at the piano, he would put one end of a pencil in his mouth and place the other end against the instrument so that he could feel the notes. Although Beethoven was able to continue composing music, it became increasingly difficult for him to perform in public. When Beethoven presented Symphony No.9 Vienna in 1824, it was his first time on stage in over ten years.  
听觉下降令贝多芬深受打击。他痛苦不堪，起初只想尽量隐瞒。他在给弟弟的信中说：“……这样一种在我身上本应比别人更加完美的感官，这样一种我曾经有绝顶禀赋的感官，如今怎能让我 承认它有了缺陷……”然而，即使在那些最晦暗的时刻，贝多芬都不曾放弃希望。虽然听不清了，但他决心想办法让生活继续充满音乐。他尝试各种各样的助听设备，让自己听到更多的声音。在钢琴上作曲时，他将铅笔的一端含在嘴里，另一端顶住钢琴，这样就能感受到音符。作曲还可以继续，但公开演出对于他而言越来越艰难了。1824年在维也纳指挥这场《第九交响曲》，是他十多年来第一次登台。  

Since that day, Beethoven’s Symphony No.9 has become one of the most famous and treasured pieces in the history of classical music. The first movement starts quietly, but all of a sudden the whole orchestra breaks into an energetic theme. You can soon feel the determination--- a quality Beethoven understood well because of his hearing difficulties-- coursing through the music. The next two movements are full of desperate lows and uplifting highs which perhaps reflect both his suffering and his strong will to fight it. The music moves through technically difficult sections with ease, showing his genius as a composer. Finally, in the fourth movement, he connects all of the different variations into a joyful chorus.  
从此，贝多芬《第九交响曲》成为古典音乐史上最著名和最受珍视的作品之一。交响曲第一章先是在平静中开始，随后，乐队全体猛然奏出一个强烈的主题。你顿时会感到贯穿整部作品的那种刚毅---那种深受听障之苦的贝多芬所熟知的品质。接下来的两个乐章，充满了绝望的低声部和激越的高声部，或许分别反映了作曲家的痛苦和与之抗争的坚强意志。即使技术难度很高的段落，音乐也都从容流过，展现了他作为作曲家的才华。最后，在第四乐章中，他将一系列形态各异的变奏合为一阙欢乐的合唱。  

As Beethoven’s last great work, his Symphony No.9 was also a grand finale to his life-- he died less than three years after the concert in Vienna, aged 56. For his amazing achievements and for his determination even in his darkest days, Beethoven is regarded as one of the most remarkable musicians who ever lived.  
《第九交响曲》是贝多芬最后一部伟大的作品，也是他的人生绝唱---距这场维也纳音乐会举办未满三年，他就去世了，终年56岁。他惊人的艺术成就，以及在至暗岁月里都不曾动摇的顽强毅力，使他被公认为有史以来最卓越的音乐家之一。  

## Unit 3 The art of painting

**First impressions第一印象**  

3 June 六月3日  
Paris, France法国巴黎  

As a huge art fan, I knew exactly what I was looking forward to most about my trip to Paris:visiting the Musee d’Orsay. Housed in an old railway building, this world-famous art museum features some of the best-known paintings from the Impressionist movement of the 19th century.  
作为一个狂热的艺术家，我非常清楚自己此次巴黎之旅最期待的是什么- - - 参观奥赛博物馆。这家世界闻名的艺术博物馆设在一座古老的铁路建筑里，以19世纪印象派运动时期一些最著名的画作为特色。  

As I wandered through the Impressionist gallery, I appreciated masterpieces like The Ballet Class and The Card Players. Even though I had admired them hundreds of times on my computer screen, nothing could have prepared me for the wonder I felt when I finally laid eyes on the real thing.While it was hard to pick a favourite painting out of so many amazing works,the artists who made the deepest impression on me were two of the greatest Impressionist painters, Claude Monet and Pierre-Auguste Renoir.  
漫步于印象派展馆，我欣赏着像《舞蹈课》和《玩纸牌者》这样的杰作。尽管我在电脑屏幕上已经欣赏过数百次，但当我终于亲眼见到实物时，还是觉得猝不及防，惊叹不已。虽然从这么多令人称奇的作品中很难选出一幅最喜欢的，但两位伟大的印象派画家给我留下了深刻的印象--克劳德·莫奈和皮埃尔-奥古斯特·雷诺阿。  

I could see from Monet’s works that he was greatly inspired by nature. In the last three decades of his life he painted mostly scenes from his garden. One of these scenes is shown in the famous piece Blue Water Lilies, which I studied for quite a while in the gallery.I couldn’t believe it when I heard he did around 250 paintings of the same water lily pond, all in different colours and styles. It is amazing that every time Monet studied this simple scene,he brought the pond’s beauty to the canvas in a unique way.  
从莫奈的作品中，我可以看出他深受大自然的启发。在他生命的最后30年里，他画的大多使自家花园的风景，其中一处风景就展现在他著名的《蓝睡莲》里，我在展馆里端详了好一阵子。当听说同一个睡莲池他画了大约250幅画，每一幅颜色和风格都各异时，我简直难以置信。令人赞叹的是，莫奈每次端详睡莲池这处简单的风景，都以独特的方式让它的美跃然于画布之上。  

Renoir, I noticed, preferred to paint scenes of everyday life. For me, the most interesting of his paintings is his 1876 masterpiece  
Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette,which shows life in a busy neighbourhood of Paris on a Sunday afternoon.When I saw it up close, I was struck by the small areas of light across the painting, and the way the soft edges of the figures seemed to mix together. There’s so much going on, but so little clear detail. This effect makes the lively movement of the dance almost jump out at the viewer.  
我注意到，雷诺阿更喜欢描绘日常生活场景。在我看来，它最有趣的画作是他1876年的杰作《煎饼魔坊的舞会》，这幅画展现了某个周日下午巴黎一处热闹街区的生活。近距离观赏，画布上遍布着小面积的光斑，人物柔和的轮廓似乎融为一体，令我大为震撼。画上呈现的内容如此丰富，但清晰的细节又如此之少。这种效果使得舞蹈动作活灵活现，引人注目。  

Although the paintings had very different settings, it was their similarities that stayed with me long after I left the Musee d’Orsay---similarities which can be seen throughout the Impressionist’s paintings. Monet and Renoir, along with other like-minded artists, sought liberation from the rules of the old style.Everyday subject matter was the main focus of their works, as opposed to the history paintings that had traditionally dominated European art. They employed free brushwork and used colours to show the effect of light on things, creating paintings that were far less realistic than the works that came before. To me, these techniques are the essence of the Impressionist view of art. Impressionist artists did not try to paint every detail in a scene--just a brief “impression” they had at that moment, burning with vivid colours and light, before it disappeared.  
尽管这两幅画的背景截然不同，但在我离开奥赛博物馆后很长一段时间里，一直萦绕着我的却是它们的相似之处 - - -这种相似之处在印象派的画作中随处可见。莫奈和雷诺阿，以及其他志趣相投的艺术家，都力求从之前风格的束缚中挣脱出来。印象派的作品主要关注日常主题，这与传统上欧洲艺术界占主流的历史题材画作大相径庭。他们运用自由的笔法，使用色彩来表现光线投射在物体上的效果，创作的画远不如前人之作那么写实。在我看来，这些技巧是印象派艺术观的精髓。印象派画家试图描绘的并非某个场景的所以细节--而是他们当时产生的瞬间“印象”，在它消失之前，迸发着鲜明的光彩。  

The Impressionists’ vision inspired a whole new generation of Post-Impressionist painters such as Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin, whose works are also displayed at the Musee d’Orsay. It is also worthy of note that Post-Impressionist painters were not the only ones to be influenced by Impressionism--the movement has had a lasting influence on modern art, encouraging artists to look at the world from an entirely new point of view. It certainly left a lasting impression on me too!  
印象派的远见卓识启发了新一代的后印象派画家，如文森特·高更，奥赛博物馆有展出他们的作品。值得注意的是，后印象派画家并不是唯一受印象派影响的群体--这场运动还对现代艺术产生了持久的影响，鼓励着艺术家们从一个全新的视觉去看待世界。当然，这也给我留下了难忘的印象！

**Qingming Scroll《清明上河图》**  

Zhang Zeduan’s Qingming Scroll is a masterwork of Chinese art. Painted on a five-metre-long silk scroll, it offers an important insight into life in China in be 12th century. It is commonly believed that the city described in the painting is Bianjing(present-day Kaifeng), the capital of the Northern Song Dynasty. The ancient scroll has survived the test of time remarkably well, and is currently housed in the Palace Museum in Beijing.  
张择端的《清明上河图》是中国艺术的杰作。此画为五米绢本长卷，它对于我们洞悉12世纪中国的生活面貌是极其重要的。人们通常认为，画中描绘的城市是汴京（今开封），即北宋的都城。这幅古老卷历经沧桑依旧完好，现藏于北京故宫博物院。  

The scroll consists of three main sections. The first section presents a peaceful scene of rural life near Bianjing, featuring crop fields, a river winding through the landscape,and farmers hard at work. The second section shows the riverbanks and the central bridge alive with activity as boats sail in and out of Bianjing. Civilians can also be seen walking through the city gate in both directions. The third and final section pictures life inside the city itself.Here, hundreds of people from all walks of life,including butchers, hairdressers and government officials,can be seen going about their daily business. The combination of these three sections gives the viewer an idea of what life was like for the people of Bianjing.  
全画可分为三部分。第一部分展现了汴京近郊恬静的乡村生活，重点描绘了农田、蜿蜒而过的河流和辛勤劳作的农民。第二部分则展现了熙熙攘攘的河岸和中心桥，往来京城的船只穿梭着。城门处能看到进进出出的百姓。第三部分，同时也是最后一部分，描绘了城内的生活。我们能看到数以百计各行EOL业的人，肉贩、理发店、官差，都在忙着各自的营生。三部分综合起来，观者便可对当时汴京人的生活状况有一大致了解。  

Zhang’s amazing artistic techniques is apparent all across the scroll. Using ink on silk,he creates realistic images of scenery,buildings and people,and displays a remarkable mastery of perspective. The most impressive aspect of the painting,however, is probably Zhang’s precise brushwork. This well-developed ability,as well as the scroll’s ambitions size, allows Zhang to show an enormous amount of detail--you could study the painting for hours and still discover something new.  
显然，张择端在整幅画中表现了他高妙的艺术技巧。他高超的艺术技巧。他施墨于娟，落笔之处，风景、建筑、人物，无不逼真传神，同时展现出透视法的精通。不过，此画最引人注目之处是其精准细腻的笔法。凭借高超的技艺，以及恢宏的画幅，画家刻画了海量的细节，哪怕端详几个小时，你还是会有新的发现。  

Thanks to all this fine detail, the Qingming Scroll provides a comprehensive look at life during the Northern Song Dynasty. It reveals a great deal about the 12th- century Chinese customs, clothing, transportation methods, business practices. At first sight, the overall scene of life in the capital city appears peaceful and cheerful. However, some critic suggest that on closer inspection, the painting actually exposes serious political and social problems. Some boats carrying food do not seem to belong to the government, which suggests that the government has lost control of food supplies and transportation. Also in the painting are soldiers who appear to ignore their duties.There are some less obvious indicators of trouble too. For example, in the centre of the scroll, a boat is in danger of crashing into the bridge. These sorts of details point to a crisis developing in the city. In fact,the Northern Song Dynasty was in decline by this stage. About twenty years after the painting was completed, it was overthrown.  
多亏这些精准的细节，《清明上河图》全面展示了北宋时期的生活景象。它透露了12世纪中国在民俗、服饰、交通方式、商业活动，以及诸如庙宇、茶馆、政府设施等种类繁多的建筑方面的诸多细节。咋看上去，京城生活总体上安宁而欢愉。然而，有评论家指出，细心观察，这幅画其实揭露了严重的政治和社会问题。有些运粮船看上去不像官船，这意味着官府已失去了对粮食供应和运输的控制。画中有些官兵似乎疏于职守。此外还有一些不好的苗头，不太容易觉察。比如，画卷中部有一艘船眼看就要撞到桥上。种种细节都预示着某种危机正在京城中酝酿。事实上，当时的北宋王朝已经在走下坡路了。这幅画完成约20年后，北宋覆灭。  

Zhang’s timeless scroll is an important example of realism in the history of Chinese paintings. Its value is down not only to its great scale, artistic quality and attention to detail, but also to its representation of daily life. Such is its worth that several later emperors even asked the most talented artists of their day to make copies of the scroll. Some of these copies are now regarded as precious works of art in their own right. With the Qingming Scroll, Zhang made an outstanding contribution to Chinese art and greatly influenced generations of future artists.  
张择端这幅不朽之作是中国绘画史上现实主义的重要典范。它的价值不仅在于画幅宏大，艺术性高，注重细节，更在于其对日常生活的再现。其价值之高，以至后世有多位皇帝令当时最有才华的画家加以临摹。其中有些摹本现今自身亦被视为艺术珍品。张择端以这幅《清明上河图》对中国艺术做出了卓越贡献，也深刻影响后世一代又一代的艺术家。  

The original scroll is still in one piece despite its age, but it is extremely delicate. Because of this ,it is not often displayed to the public. The last time it was on exhibition, crowds waited in line for hours for the rare chance to see the famous painting with their own eyes. The public’s continued enthusiasm about the Qingming Scroll, even after all these centuries, speaks volumes about the power of this historic piece of art.  
尽管年代久远，此画原作仍然完好，但已极为脆弱。有鉴于此，它很少公开示人。上一次展出时，观众为了这个一睹名画真容的难得机遇，不惜排几个小时的队。甚至在几个世纪之后，公众对《清明上河图》仍热情不减，这足以证明这幅历史名画的魅力。  

## Unit 4 Exploring poetry  

### Reading  
**How to read a poem**  
**如何阅读诗歌**  

Poetry is a combination of “sound” and “sense”. More than any other type of literature, it usually implies a deeper meaning beyond the words on the page . So, how to reveal this hidden dimension?  
诗歌是“音”与“意”的融合。与其他任何文学类型相比，诗歌通常隐含着超越字面的更深层含义。那么，如何揭示隐藏的这个方面呢？  

First, follow your ears. While you may ask “What does it mean?” as you begin reading a poem, it is better to ask “How does it sound?” Even if its true meaning appears to be beyond your grasp,you can always say something about how the poem sounds when you read it aloud. Do you detect a rhythm? Are there any repeated words,rhymes or other special effects? All of these are good qualities to notice, and they may lead you to a better understanding of the poem in the end. Read these lines to feel how they sound.  
首先，凭听觉的指引。当你刚开始读一首诗时，你可能会问： “这是什么意思？”但最好问一句： “它听起来怎么样？”即使你也许把握不住这首诗的正在含义，但是当你大声朗读时，你总是可以说说这首诗听上去如何。你能感觉到节奏吗？有没有重复词、押韵或其他特别的效果？所有这些都是值得注意的特质，它们可能最终会帮助你更好地理解这首诗。朗读下面这几句诗，感受它们的音律。  

> Sweet and low, sweet and low,轻轻地，柔和地；轻轻地，柔和地  
> Wind of the western sea, 西边的海风  
> Low, low, breathe and blow, 吹过，拂过，轻轻，轻轻  
> Wind of the western seal!西边的海风！  
> Over the rolling waters go,；来自月色朦胧，  
> Come from the dying moon,and below,拂过波涛汹涌，  
> Blow him again to me;请将他再吹响我；  
> While my little one, while my pretty one,sleeps.  
> 当我的小宝贝，小可爱，已入梦  
> (From “Sweet and Low”by Alfred Tennyson)  
> （摘自Alfred Tennyson 《轻轻地，柔和地》）  

Second, approach the poem as if you were an explorer in an unfamiliar landscape. Ask some basic questions about the poem. Who is talking? Who is being talked to? What is being described? Is there a sense of place? Are there other people or objects there? As you explore the poem, you will begin to see images in your mind. What are those images, and what happens when they are put together? This combination is often complex or even contradictory. As you slowly explore your surroundings, you will start to dig up clues that give you a greater understanding of the poem. Read these lines, pay attention to the image of the caged bird and try to find out what it means.  
第二，走进诗歌，就像你是一个置身于陌生风景中的探索者。问自己一些关于这首诗的基本问题。说话的是谁？正在和谁说话？描述的是什么？有感觉到某个地点吗？那里还有其他人或物吗？当你探索这首诗的时候，你的脑海会开始浮现一些画面。这些画面是什么？把它们组合起来会发生什么？这种组合通常是复杂的，甚至是矛盾的。当你慢慢探索周围环境时，你会开始挖掘线索，这些线索会让你更好地理解这首诗。读下面这几句诗，注意“笼中鸟”的形象，试着弄清它意味着什么.  

> The caged bird sings 笼中之鸟，  
> with a fearful trill 撕心裂肺，啼啭啾啾  
> of things unknown 所唱是未知之物，  
> but longed for still 却依然渴求  
> and his tune is heard  
> on the distant hill 歌声传到了远处的山丘  
> for the caged bird  
> sings of freedom. 因为笼中的鸟儿在歌唱自由。  
> (From “Caged Bird” by Maya Angelou) （摘自玛雅 安吉洛《笼中鸟》）  

Third, if you are still struggling to interpret the meaning of a poem even with much painstaking effort, just have some patience. You cannot really understand a poem that you have only read once. Sometimes reading a poem can be a lifelong job. So if you do not get it, set the poem aside and come back to it later.As an explorer, you will not reach your goal immediately--- you need to go on a journey to a remote and unknown destination. This may seem difficult at first, but when you finally make your great discovery, your efforts will be rewarded. Poems that are easy to understand are often less interesting than those that constantly reveal deeper and previously unrecognized meanings. Read these lines and try to find out what they mean.  
第三，如果你下了很大的功夫可还是纠结于理解一首诗的意思，那就耐心一点吧。你不可能正在理解只读过一遍的诗。有时，读懂一首诗可能是一辈子的事。所以如果你没有读懂某一首诗，那就暂且先放在一边，以后再读。作为一个探索者，你不会立刻抵达你的目标- - -你需要踏上旅程，去一个遥远未知的目的地。这一开始可能看起来很难，但当你最终有了重大发现时，你的努力将得到回报。有些诗的深层内涵和之前未领会的意义会不断显现，相比之下，那些浅显的诗往往倒没那么有趣了。读下面这几句诗，看看是什么意思吧。  

> Whose woods these are I think I know.  
> 我想我知道这片林子的主人，  
> His houses is in the village though;  
> 尽管他住在山村。  
> He will not see me stopping here  
> 他不会见我驻足于此，  
> To watch his woods fill up with snow.  
> 凝视着他积满白雪的树林。  
> (From “Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening “by Robert Frost)（摘自Robert Frost 《雪夜林边小驻》）  

Finally, remember that you do not have to fully understand a poem to appreciate it. You might need to abandon logical thinking to discover its true inner beauty. As long as the journey of poetry reading makes you feel something or lets you perceive another level of meaning, it will have been worth your effort.  
最后请记住，欣赏一首诗，并非得完全理解它不可。你可能需要抛开逻辑思维以发现诗歌真正的内在美。只要读诗之旅能让你有所感触，或者你领悟到另一层含义，那你的努力就是值得的。  

Poetry’s combination of “sound” and “sense” makes you see the world in a new way and allows you to go beyond normal reality for the everlasting beauty.Enjoy your journey in the world of poetry!  
诗歌“音”与“意”的结合，让你用一种新的方式看待世界，让你超越普通的现实，追求永恒之美。在诗歌的世界里享受你的旅程吧！  

### Extended reading  
**Li Bai and his romantic poetry**  

> A hundred feet the temple towers;    危楼高百丈，  
> I can reach out for the stars in the sky. 手可摘星辰。  
> But I dare not speak in a voice loud,   不敢高声语，  
> For fear of scaring dwellers on high.   恐惊天上人。  
> (“A Night Stay at a Mountain Temple”)  

It is believed that this poem was written by Li Bai in his teenage years. With striking imagination in expressions like “scaring dwellers on high”, this early poem already displayed signs of a romantic style, which was later to characterize Li Bai’s poetry.  
相传此诗为李白少年时所作。在这首早期作品中，“恐惊天上人”等诗句想象奇绝，已经展现出一种浪漫主义风格，这一风格后来成为李白诗歌的特色。  

Li Bai’s love of reading and travelling from an early age contributed to his romantic style. He started studying the classics when he was only o five years old, and was reading ancient philosophers of different schools at the age of ten, including Confucianism and Taoism. By reading books of all kinds, from legends to historical stories, he familiarized himself with classical Chinese culture, and more importantly, he acquired the wisdom of previous generations.  
李白的浪漫主义风格与其自幼喜读书、好游历不无关联。他五岁就诵读经典，十岁读儒道等诸子百家的著作。他博览群书，从传奇故事到历史典故无所不窥，从而对古代经典文化谙熟于心，更重要的是，他从中汲取了先贤们的智慧。  

Driven by a burning desire for adventure and travel, Li Bai left home and started to travel around in his early twenties. His footsteps covered almost the whole country. During his travels,he visited famous mountains and great rivers, encountering different customs and practices. These travelling experiences also nourished his love of nature and inspired him to write numerous poems in the romantic style.  
在强烈的探索欲和游历欲的驱使下，他二十几岁便离家周游，足迹几乎遍及海内。他一路寻访名山大川，见识各地文化风俗。这些旅途见闻培养了他对自然的热爱，也让他诗兴大发，写下了无数浪漫主义的作品。  

Li Bai’s romantic style was also deeply rooted in the social and historical context in which he lived. Li Bai grew up in the most glorious period of the Tang Dynasty, a time of economic boom and social stability. This open and tolerant atmosphere allowed Li Bai the liberty to develop a free and unconstrained personality, which, in turn, had a huge impact on his poetic production.  
李白的浪漫主义风格亦深植于他所处的社会历史环境中。他长于经济繁荣、国家安定的盛唐。这种开放而包容的氛围，使李白得以率性放达，养成了自由不羁的性格，进而极大地影响了他的诗歌创作。  

Given his personal experiences and the historical background, it is only natural to see that the majority of Li Bai’s poems are characterized by the romantic style. Even the most uninformed reader would not fail to be impressed by the poet’s rich imagination. The moon and stars in the sky, the natural landscape and the figures in legends all become a vehicle for his imagination.Equally impressive is Li Bai’s free expression of strong feelings, which breathes vitality into the lifeless objects he describes, and which distinguishes him from other landscape poets. These features are inseparable from Li Bai’s wide use of exaggeration, metaphor and other artistic techniques. The poem below, written in his fifties, is representative of him romantic style:  
有如此的个人阅历和历史背景，李白多数作品皆富有浪漫主义色彩就不足为奇了。哪怕再没有文化的读者，也会为诗人丰富的想象力所折服。天上星月、自然景观、传奇人物，他都可借以发挥想象力。同样令人叹服的是李白对强烈情感的恣意抒发，笔下万物都被赋予灵性，这也让他与其他的山水诗人迥然有别。这些特征也离不开他对夸张、比喻等艺术手法的广泛运用。下面这首诗是他五十多岁时所作，是其浪漫主义风格的集中体现：  

> My silver hair is three thousand feet long, 白发三千丈，  
> Because my sorrow is deep and strong.    缘愁似个长。  
> How can the autumn frost white         不知明镜里，  
> Be cast into the mirror bright?          何处得秋霜？  
> (“Autumn Frost”)                    (秋浦歌）  

With his extraordinary imagination, free expression of strong feelings and mastery of language, Li Bai is widely recognized as the greatest romantic poet after Qu Yuan. Generations of poets,both in China and abroad, owe a debt to his inspirational poems. One such poet is Ezra Pound, a 20th-century American poet. He was fascinated by Li Bai’s poems and translated some of them in his 1915 poetry collection entitled Cathay. Today Li Bai’s poetry continues to be enjoyed by countless readers around the world.  
超尘脱俗的想象，强烈情感的自由抒发，以及对语言的精通，使李白被公认为是继屈原之后最伟大的浪漫主义诗人。他的诗篇滋养着中国乃至海外一代又一代诗人。其中一位便是20世纪美国诗人Ezra Pound。他倾慕李白的诗，选择了多首收入他1915年出版的诗歌集《华夏集》中。时至今日，李白的诗歌仍然为世界各地无数读者所喜爱。

Firefighters quickly put out the Henderson Tower fire last night. The fire, which is thought to have started from the 8th floor; spread quickly through the tower block on Sunday night, leaving people on the upper floors trapped.Fears grew that the number of deaths could reach 5, according to figures released by emergency services. Fire engines and ambulances called at 9: 30 p. m, reached the scene within 15 minutes. By this time, the fire had extended to the 15th floor. Firefighters got the situation under control around 11 p. m. There is concern that the construction company that built the tower block had not followed fire safety rules.  
消防队员昨晚迅速扑灭了亨德森楼的大火。周日晚上的大火被认为是从9楼开始的，很快延到整座公 寓大楼，把位于高楼层的人们困在了里面。根据应急服务构公布的数据，死亡人数恐将达到12人。21时 30分，消防车和救护车接到报警，于15分钟内抵达现场。至此时，火势己蔓延到16楼。消防队员在23时 左右控制住了火情。有人担心修建公寓大楼的建筑公司没有遵守消防安全规定。

**公寓发生致命火灾，造成重大损失**  

A terrible fire broke out on Sunday night, leaving the Henderson Tower seriously damaged. Emergency services estimate that the number of deaths could reach 9. By this morning, 4 people have been confirmed dead. The fire has also left dozens of people injured, 5 of whom are in a critical condition.Lisa Mayer, 29, is among the lucky ones who only suffered minor injuries. She recalled, " I was about to have a bath when I heard people screaming and dogs barking. I looked outside and the smoke was choking me. It was like an awful dream."  
周日晚上发生了一场严重的火灾，导致德森楼严重受损。应急服务机构估计死亡人数可能达到30人。 至今天早上，己经有9人确认死亡，还有几十人仍处于失踪状态。火灾还造成16人受伤，其中5人伤势严 重。29岁的莉萨•梅耶是幸运儿之一，只受了轻伤，她回忆说，“我正要洗澡，突然听到人们的尖叫声和 狗吹声。我看了看外面，烟呛得我喘不过气来。这就像一场噩梦。”  

Mr Peterson, head of the fire service, confirms that a 10 dropped cigarette end on a carpet of the 8th floor started the fire and that the automatic fire alarms did not go off quickly enough to prevent the disaster. A team is currently investigating the accident further.  
消防部门的负责人得森先生证实是掉在9楼地上的香烟引发了火灾，而且火灾自动报警器没能及时响 起，以致未能及时阻止灾难的发生。一组人员正在对事故进行进一步调査。  

**Reading news reports critically 批判性地阅读新闻报道**  

We rely on news to learn about what is happening in the world around us.However, we usually find that reports on the same events contain different or even contradictory information, How do these differences come about?  
我们依靠新闻来了解周围的世界正在发生的事情。然而，我们通常发现，对于同一事件的报道包含着 不同的，甚至是相互矛盾的信息。这些差异是如何产生的呢？  

It is advisable to remember that journalists may have different priorities, which 5 would influence how they report an event. Let's take the two news reports on the  
Henderson Tower Fire as an example. We can see that the first news report pays more attention to the rescue efforts, while the second talks more about deaths and injuries. When we read more than one report, we come to understand an event in a more comprehensive way.  
最好要记住，新闻报道是由记者写的，他们可能关注的重点不同，并选择就自己的重点写一篇报道。 让我们以亨德森火灾的两篇新闻报道为例。我们可以看到，第一篇新闻报道更多地关注救援工作，而第二 篇新闻报道更多地谈论伤亡人数。当我们阅读多篇报道时，我们就会更全面地了解一个事件。  

Even if news reports are written from basically the same perspective, they may contradict each other in terms of factual details, as events in the real world are usually complicated and constantly changing. For instance, the numbers of deaths differ in the two news reports on the Henderson Tower fire. When we come across such factual differences, we should not rush to the conclusion that one of 15 the news reports gives false information. Instead, check when the reports were written. News reports written at different stages of an event could contain different information as new facts are brought to light. Another aspect worthy of mention is that journalists may approach information they get from research or interviews differently. Suppose emergency services estimates of the number of deaths vary 20 between 5 and 9. Journalists may choose to present the minimum, the maximum or something in between in their news reports. Therefore, checking different sources enables us to draw a more informed conclusion.  
即使新闻报道的撰写视角基本一致，它们也可能在事实细节上相互矛盾，因为现实世界中的事件通常 是复杂且不断变化的。例如，关于亨德森楼火灾的两篇新闻报道中，死亡人数是不同的•当你发现这些事 实的差异时，不要急于下结论，认为其中一篇新闻报道给出了错误的信息。相反，要去实报道撰写的时间。 随着新的事实不断被披露，在同一事件的不同阶段撰写的新闻报道可能色含不同的信息。另一个値得一提 的方面是，记者可能会以不同的方式处理从研究或釆访中得到的数据。假设应急服务机构对死亡人数的估 计在12人至30人之间。记者在新闻报道中可能选择呈现最小值、最大值或任何介于两者之间的数值。因 此，阅读不同来源的新闻报道能使我们得出更明智的结论。  

To sum up, it is wise to read news reports written from various perspectives and at different stages, which brings us a more accurate understanding of a situation 25 We also need to be critical about the information we receive and remember not to blindly trust what we have read. Though journalists are committed to presenting the truth, it is better to use our own judgement than rely entirely on news reports.With great discrimination, every one of us has the potential to be a critical news reader.  
总的来说，不妨阅读从不同角度撰写的新闻报道，以及事件不同阶段的报道，这会让我们更准确地把 握情况。我们也需要对接收到的信息持批判态度，并记住不要官目相信我们读到的东西。尽管记者致力于 在他们的报道中呈现真相，我们最好还是运用自己的判断力，而非完全依赖单一的新闻来源。只要具备强 大的辨别力，我们每一个人都有潜力成为有判断力的新闻读。

**Advertising； the power of persuasion**  
**广告:说服的力量**  

In just one day, a person can see hundreds of marketing messages. Advertising has become part of modern life. But what is advertising exactly? In short, it refers to the activity of promoting a product or service. In other words, it tries to persuade people to buy a product or service.  
在仅仅一天之内，一个人可以看到数百条营销信息。广告己经成为我们现代生活的一部分。但广告到 底是什么？简而言之，广告指推销一种产品或服务的活动。換言之，它（广告）试图说服你去购买一种产品或 服务。  

The history of advertising has always been closely linked with that of the mass media From the ancient simple advertisements painted on outdoor signs to the colourful, interactive ones in smartphone apps, advertising and the mass media have developed hand in hand. As media channels have grown in number and type, so have advertisements.  
广告的历史一直与大众传媒的历史紧密相连。从最初报纸上简单的黑白广告到智能手机应用程序上多 彩的互动广告，大众传媒和广告携手发展。正如体道的数量和类型不断增长一样，广告也是如此。  

Because the mass media reaches so many people, it is a perfect vehicle for advertisers. If an advertisement is placed on a popular website or on TV at peak times, a huge number of people will know about the product or service it is advertising. In addition to making people aware of a product or service, a successful advertisement will also create a desire to buyz thus boosting business, That is why 15 when a company wants to promote a product or service, it often launches a mass media advertising campaign.  
大众传媒受众很广，因此成为广告商的完美体。如果在一个热门网站或电视节目的黄金时段投放一则 广告，数百万人都会知晓它所宣传的产品或服务。除了让人们了解产品或服务，一则成功的广告也会激发 人们的购买欲，从而促进业务增长。那就是一家公司如果想要推广一种产品或服务，就经常会发起一场大 众传广告活动的原因。  

Based on the psychology behind creating a desire to buyz advertisers have developed ways of persuading people into purchasing their products or services. A common technique to make an impact is to create a memorable slogan. Slogans use simple 20 but impressive language to make us remember the product or service being advertised. Some of these slogans may also appeal to our emotions. For example, a slogan may connect a fine china teapot it aims to promote with our pride in having good taste. You will hear a variety of slogans any time you watch TV. Think about your favourite one. What makes it special? And what message does it try to get across? A slogan which communicates an idea effectively can boost sales and even become part of popular culture. That is the power of memorable slogans.  
基于激发购买欲背后的心理，广告商开发了说服人们购买其产品或服务的方式。一种常见的富有冲击 力的手法是创造一条令人难的广告词•广告词用语简单，但今人印象深刻，能让我们记住所宣传的产品或 服务。其中一些广告词可能也会引起我们的情感共•例如，一条广告词可能会把想要推的一个精美的陶茶 和我们引以为做的良好品味联系起来。每当你打开电视，你都会听到各种各样的广告词。想想你最喜欢的 那一条。它有什么特别之处?它想要传达什么信息?一条能有效地传达思想的广告词可以增加销售量，甚至 成为流行文化的部分。那就是今人难忘的广告词的力量。  

Another technique advertisers often employ is to link their company or product to a"brand ambassador"-a famous actor, a sports star, or even a fictional character. Think of a popular fast-food restaurant. Does it have a brand ambassador? Is the 30 brand ambassador popular among potential customers? The more we like the brand ambassador, the more we will be attracted to buy the product.  
一部分广告商经常使用的另一种手法是将他们的公司成产品与一个“品牌大使”联系起来-……一位著名 的演员、体育明星甚至是一个虚构的人物。想想一家受欢的快餐店。它有品牌大使吗?品牌大使应在潜在客 户中享有知名度。我们越喜欢这位品牌大使，就越会被吸引去购买这个产品。  

Of course, some advertisements are not so obvious: product placement is typically used in films with huge box-office success and TV shows with high ratings. Some films are now sponsored by leading brands, so that only their products appear in the films, like the watches worn by the title character in the James Bond films. Other types of mass media use product placement too, including video games. It is not uncommon for sports video game series to feature different in-game equipment with real brand names, We absorb these marketing messages without thin king about them too much, yet they will probably have an effect on us the next time we go shopping.  
当然，有些广告并不是那么明显。例如，植入广告常用于高收视率的电影和电视节目。现在有些电影 由知名品牌赞助，所以只有他们的产品出现在电影中，比如簷姆斯•邦德电影中主角戴的手表。其他类型的 大众媒也使用植入广告，包括电子游戏。在体育类电子游戏系列中，给不同游戏备贴上真实品牌标签是很 常见的。我们不假恶就接收了这些营信息，而这些信息有可能对我们下次购物产生影响。  

In the past, advertising was all about reaching as many people as possible with the same message. Now, advertising is becoming more digital and more personalized. Already we may see online advertisements for products or services we have previously searched for on the Internet, and we are very likely to receive special discounts and promotions targeted specifically at us. In the future, advertising will be even more about understanding individual customers and sending them advertisements that are tailored to specific needs. Not only will this make them feel more valued and enable them to see what they are most interested in, but it will also help companies target their customers more efficiently to have a positive effect on sales.  
过去，广告是以同样的信息打动尽可能多的人。现在，广告正变得越来越数字化和个性化。如果我们以 前在网上搜索过某个产品，我们现在就可能看到这个产品的在线广告，还很可能会收到专门针对我们的特 殊折扣和促销活动•未来，广告甚至会更多地了解个人客户，并根据其特位定需求推送广告。这不仅会让 他们感觉更受重视，让他们能看到自己最感兴趣的东西，也会帮助公司有效地定位客户，以对销售产生积 极的影响。

**The Olympic Games**  
**奥林匹克运动会**  

Every four years, thousands of highly trained and talented athletes gather together in the spirit of friendship, solidarity and fair playz ready to test their abilities against each other in the hope of being recognized as the best of the best. This is the Olympics 一 an extraordinary sporting event that was first celebrated about 3,000 years ago.  
每隔四年，成千上万训练有素、极具天赋的运动员承着友谊、团结和公平争的奥林匹克精神 聚集在一起，准备挑战彼此的能力，希望成为世界公认的精英中的精英。这就是奥林匹克运动 会项非凡的体育赛事，首次举办于大约3, 000年前。  

The ancient Olympic Games began in the year 776 BCE. During the early Games, only Greek men were allowed to participate. They competed in such events as boxing, running and the long jump. The ancient Olympic Games were held at Olympia in Greece every four years for almost 12 centuries, until they eventually died out around the year 393.  
首届古代奥林匹克运动会于公元前77年举办。在早期的运会上，只有希腊男子才被允许参加 比赛。他们参加的比赛项目有拳击、赛跑和跳远等。古代林匹克运动会每四年在希腊的奥林匹 亚举行一次，持续了近12个世纪，直到393年左右才最终停止举办。  

More than 1,500 years later, however, the Games rose again. The modern Olympics were first held in 1896, in Athens. It was a Frenchman, Pierre de Coubertin, who brought the Olympics back to life. His dream was that the Olympics would help people of different racial origins and from different cultures live side by side in peace. For over a century, people from diverse backgrounds have made joint efforts to help realize Coubertin* s dream.Motivated by the Olympic motto “Faster, Higher; Strongern , many well-known athletes, both male and female, have devoted themselves to achieving sporting excellence and pushing the boundaries of human achievement.  
但是1, 500多年后，奥运会再次兴起。首届现代奥运会于1896年在雅典举行。是一位叫皮 块尔德•顾拜旦的法国人使奥运会重现生机。他的梦想是奥运会能够帮助不同种族、不同文化 的人们和平共处。一个多世纪以来，来自不同背景的人们共同努力，帮助实现顾拜旦的梦想。 他们当中有许多著名的运动员，有男有女。在奥林匹克口号“更快、更高、更强”的激励下， 他们力争取得体育运动上的杰出成就并不断突破人类成就的极限。  

One such Olympian was the boxer Cassius Clay. He came to public attention during the 1960 Rome Olympics, when he won the light-heavyweight gold medal for the USA, demonstrati ng great talent and personality in the process. Afterwards, this young man proceeded to become the world heavyweight champion in 1964, and later changed his name to the one we all know— Muhammad Ali. He returned to the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games to light the Olympic flame at the opening ceremony. By the time he died in 2016z Ali had been recognized as one of the greatest boxers of all time.  
奥林匹克运动会上的知名运动员拳击手卡修新-克莱就是这样一位奥运选手。他在1960年罗 马奥运会上引起了人们的关注，当时他为美国赢得了轻重量级拳击金牌，并在比赛过程中展现 了过人的天赋和优秀的品性。之后，这个年轻人接着在1964年赢得了世界重量级拳击锦标赛 冠军，后来改名为我们熟知的那个名字一穆军默德•阿里。他重返1996年亚特兰大奥运会， 在开幕式上点燃奥运圣火。到2016年去世时，阿里一直被公认为有史以来最伟大的拳击手之 O  

Another sportsperson that should be applauded is Jessica Ennis-Hill. Her story is a remarkable example of how hard work and devotion can lead to sporting excellence. A former track and field athlete from the UK, she won an Olympic gold medal in her home country in 2012. As if that were not enough, she returned to the Olympics and won a silver medal in 2016, just two years after giving birth to her first child. In an interview she revealed that the secret of her consistent good performance was the training that she never missed.  
另一位值得称赞的运动员是杰西卡•思尼斯-希尔。她的故事很好地例证了在一项运动中努力和 投入可以让你出类拔萃。她曾是英国的田径运动员，并于2012年在祖国赢得了一枚奥运会金 牌。似乎这还不够，她仅在生完一个孩子两年后的2016年，就重返奥运会，并获得了银牌。 在一次采访中，她透露始终保持好的表现的秘诀是她从未停止训练。  

The 2008 Beijing Olympics called on the whole world to join in the Olympic spirit and build a better future for humanity with the slogan "One World, One Dreamw . In addition to hosting the Olympics for the first time, China also ranked first in the medal table. This success is truly remarkable if you consider that just 24 years before, at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, Xu Haifeng won our country ' s first-ever gold medal. Since then the upward trend for Chinese sport has been unstoppable. At the 2004 Athens Olympic Games, Liu Xiang became the first Asian to win the gold medal in the men ' s 110-metre hurdles, while at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, the Chinese women * s volleyball team won a hard-fought victory in the final. The year 2022 will be another historic moment for China, as Beijing won the election to host the Winter Olympics.  
2008年北京运会的官方口号是“同一个世界，同一个梦想〃，号召全世界一起弘扬奥林匹克精 神，为人类建设更美好的未来。这是中国首次举办奥运会，也是首次登顶奖牌榜。想想24年 前的1984年洛杉奥运会，许海峰为中国赢得了第一枚金牌，那么这种成功就显得非同寻常了。 从那以后，中国体育的上升趋势就一直势不可挡。在2004年雅典奥运会上，刘翔成为第一个 获得男子110米跨栏的亚洲人，而在2016年里约热内卢运会上，中国女子球队在决赛中赢得 了一场艰苦的胜利。北京当选2022年冬季奥运会主办城市，于是2022年对中国来说将是另一 个历史性的时刻。  

The Olympic Games bring joy and excitement to people across the world. As Coubertin believed, “With the Olympic Games, each generation celebrates its advent, its joy of living, its faith in the future, its ambition and its will to ascend."  
奥林匹克运动会给全世界人民带来欢乐和兴奋。正如顾拜旦所说:“有了奥林匹克运动会，每一 代人都在庆祝它的到来，庆祝它给生活带来的喜悦，庆祝它对未来的信念，庆祝它的雄心壮志 和它向上的意志。"

**Sports idoms**  
**体育习语**  

Every language has its idioms, which are groups of words with meanings different from the meanings of the individual words. Idioms make language more colourful and expressive. Since sport is an inseparable part of day-to-day life, there are lots of sports idioms that have found their way into everyday language. Let' s take a look at some of them! 每一种语言都有习语，习语由词组构成，其蕴含的意义往往不能从词组中单个词的意思推测而 得。习语使语言更加丰富多彩，富有表现力。由于体育是全球文化的重要组成部分，日常用语 中已经出现了许多体育习语。让我们来看看其中的一些体育习语吧！  

**Football**  
**足球**  

Football （or soccer, as it is called in the USA） is one of the most popular sports in the world and many countries have their own football leagues. The English language is full of idioms which are thought to have come from football.  
足球（football,美国称为soccer）是世界上最受欢迎的运动之一，许多国家都有自己的足球联赛。 英语中有很多习语都被认为是源于足球。  

As you know, in a football match, players try to kick or head the ball into the opposing team' s goal, which is the net between two big goalposts fixed to the ground. Can you imagine that every time you have a chance to score, the goalposts are moved? That would be not only difficult, but also upsetting. If someone u moves the goalposts M in everyday life, it means they unfairly change the rules or requirements for something. An insurance salesman who is about to reach his annual sales target, only for the company to make the target higher, could rightly complain about the company moving the goalposts.  
你可能知道，在足球比赛中，球员试图将球赐进顶进对方的球门，球门是固定在地上的两个大 门柱之间的。你能想象，每当你有机会进球时，球门柱就被移动吗?这不仅很难做到，而且也 是令人不快的。如果有人在日常生活中“移动门柱〃，这意味着他们不公平地改变了某个过程的 规则或要求。一位保推鋪员即将达到他的年度销售目标，但公司却把目标定得更高，那他就可 以理由充分地抱怨公司是在“移动球门柱  

Thankfully, goalposts do not really move—but when a player scores an own goal, he or she might wish they did. "Scoring an own goal ” in football means accidentally kicking or heading the ball into one' s own net, and it is one of the worst things that can happen to a football player. If someone makes a bad mistake which unintentionally harms their own interests, they are said to have scored an own goal. You might see this expression in the newspapers when the local council makes a decision which backfires terribly!  
谢天谢地，足门柱并不会真正移动。一但当一名球员把球踢进自家的球门时，他/她可能会希 望球门会移动就好了。在足球运动中，Scoring an own goal（a乌龙球）〃的意思是不小心把球踢 进了自己方的球门，对足球运动员来说，这是最糟糕的事情之一。如果有人犯了一个严重的错 误，无意中损害了自己的利益，就被说成是“进乌龙球〃。如果地方议会做出了一个完全适得其 反的决定时，你可能会在报纸上看到这种说法！  

**Baseball**  
**棒球**  

Baseball is an old and popular sport that has given the English language many different idioms. You might have heard expressions like “ in the ballpark or “a ballpark estimaten . The venue where a baseball game is played is called a ballpark. So, even if we do not know exactly where the ball is during the game, we can assume that it is somewhere in the ballpark. For this reason, people use the expression “ in the ballpark " or " a ballpark estimate " to talk about rough estimates.  
棒球是一项古老而流行的运动，它给英语带来了许多不同的习语。你可能听过in the ballpark）差不多）”或“a ballpark estimate!大致的估计）〃这样的表达。举行棒球比赛的场地叫作 ballpark ** e所以，即使我们不知道球在比赛中的确切位置，我们也可以假设它在球场里的某 个地方。因此，商业人士使用短语“in the ballpark”或"a ballpark estimate''来谈论粗略的估计。  

Another common baseball expression is 44 throwing someone a curveball". Curveballs are balls that suddenly turn in the air; and these are of course difficult for the other team to handle. We use this expression to describe things that are unexpected and difficult to respond to. "Three strikes and you are out" is another idiom that comes from baseball. As it suggests, in baseball this means that a batter （the person with the baseball bat in his or her hands ） is out after making three unsuccessful attempts to hit the ball. This idiom is often us ed to talk about situations where people fail after wasting three chances.  
还有一个常见的与棒球有关的短语是throwing someone a curve ball（给某人出难题广。/z Curve balls（曲线球）〃是指在空中突然转向的球，这对敌队来说当然很难应对。我们用这个表达来描述 出乎意料和难以回应的事情。“Three strikes and you are out（三振出局广是另一个来自棒球的习 语。如其字面意思所示，在棒球运动中，击球手（手里拿着棒球球棒的人）连续三次都未击中球， 就出局了。这个习语经常用来形容你错失了三次机会的情况。  

**Boxing**  
**拳击**  

English also has a large number of idioms connected with boxing, which has been a popular sport for thousands of years. A boxer is not allowed to use his or her fists to hit the opponent below the waist. Hence comes the idiom 44 below the belt". In day-to-day life, if someone makes an unfair and cruel remark, we can describe it as “ below the belt".  
拳击是一项流行了几千年的运动，英语中也有很多与其有关的习语。拳击手不允许用他/她的 拳头击打对手腰部以下的部位。因此就有了hitting below the belt（做不公正、伤人的事广这一 习语。在日常生活中，如果有人言论有失公平，过于残忍，我们可以用hitting below the belt 来形容。  

uThrowing in the towel" is another common idiom that comes from boxing. When a boxer is losing badly and is too tired or confused to give up on his or her own, the coach will literally throw a towel into the ring to end the fight. In everyday life, this idiom simply means admitting defeat and giving up.  
Throwing in the towelf认输）〃是另一个来自拳击的常见习语。如果一名拳击手输得很惨，并因为 太累或神志不清而无法自己认输时，教练就会形式意义上往台上扔一条毛中来结束比赛。在日 常生活中，这个习语就是指认输并投降。  

Sport is challenging and so is life. However, when you are thrown a curveball, do not throw in the towel一work hard, be careful not to score an own goal, and you are sure to make it!  
运动是具有挑战性的，学英语也一样。但是，当你遇到出人意料的事情(be thrown a curve ball) 时，不要认输(throw in the towel),——努力，小心别闹乌龙(score an own goal),你一定能获得 成功！

**The future is in our genes**  
**我们的基因決定了未来**  

Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you all for coming to this lecture. Over the course of my career; I have seen many wonderful scientific developments, but none are as game-changing as genome editing. I am full of excitement about the possibilities this scientific advance can bring and I hope to share my excitement with you today.  
女士们，先生们，下午好!谢谢大家来听这个讲座。在我的职业生涯中，我见证了许多了 不起的科学发展，但没有一个能像基因组编辑那样具有颠覆性。我对这一科学进步能带来的可 能性感到万分激动，我希望今天能与你们分享我激动的心情。  

As many of you may already know, genes play a critical role in shaping our lives. Everything from the colour of our eyes to our talent for maths depends on genes. The complete set of genes inside a cell or any living being is called a genome. Our own personal genome carries all the information needed to make us grow and develop. It also contains information that helps determine our lifespan and affects our chances of contracting certain diseases. Some people, for example, carry a gene that makes them more likely to catch a certain virus or develop a particular form of cancer.  
你们很多人可能已经知道，基因在塑造我们的人生方面起着至关重要的作用。从眼睛的颜 色到我们的数学天赋，一切都取决于基因。基因组是指一个细胞或任生物体内的一整套基因。 我们的个人基因组携带着我们成长和发展所需的所有信息。它（基因组）还包含其他信息，这些 信息有助于决定我们寿命的长短并影响我们患某些疾病的概率。例如，有些人携带着一种让他 们更有可能感染某种病毒或患上某种癌症的基因。  

Geneticists have been trying to identify which genes relate to which diseases, as they believe genome editing is an effective means of disease treatment and prevention. It allows geneticists to make changes to the genome by correcting, adding, deleting or replacing specific parts of the genetic material. In the near future, geneticists hope to apply this technology to treat a wide range of health problems. Soon we may be able to use such treatments to restore a blind person' s vision or give someone who was born deaf an excellent sense of hearing. Ultimately, this new technology might even make it possible to prevent diseases from ever developing by correcting abnormal genes early on. Genome editing, serving as a new weapon in the fight against diseases, will lead to a fundamental change in our approach to health care.  
遺传学家一直试图找出哪些基因与哪些疾病有关，因为他们认为基因组编是治疗和预防疾 病的一种有效手段。基因组编允许传学家对基因组进行修改，纠正、增加、删除或替换传物质 的特定部分。在不久的将来，遗传学家希望将这项技术应用于治疗各种各样的健康问题中。也 许我们很快就能利用这些法来恢复盲人的视力，或者让先天性耳聋的人拥有敏锐的听力。最终, 这项新技术甚至可能通过早期纠正异常基因来预防患病。基因组编作为对抗疾病的新武器，将 给我们的医疔保健手段带来重大变革。  

As the technology continues to develop at a fast pace, however, questions arise about how to use it appropriately. Should we restrict our use of this technology to the treatment and prevention of diseases? Should we prohibit geneticists from using it to enhance healthy bodies? One day soon we will be able to use genome editing to increase the human resistance to colds and flus, to make people tallerzto help their muscles develop faster, to sharpen all of their senses or to make them more intelligent. We will be able to select specific characteristics for children before they are born, creating what some have called udesigner babies" . However, is this a good thing? What consequences might it have? Philosophers, geneticists and government officials have all started to wrestle with such moral issues. We have to figure out how to keep the technology from running wild. This means putting appropriate controls in place to make sure that genome editing will work to our advantage. Without them, genome editing could be as dangerous as a car out of control.  
然而，随着这一技术不断迅猛发展，如何恰当地使用这一技术也成了问题。我们是否应该 将这种技术的使用限制在治疗和预防疾病方面?我们是否应该禁止遺传学家使用它（基因组编 辑技术）来增强人们的身体健康?不久的将来，我们将能够使用基因组编来增强人类对感冒和流 感的抵抗力，使人类长得更高，进人类肌肉更快发育，提高人类感官的敏锐程度，或使人类更 加聪明。我们将能够在孩子出生前为他们选择特定的特征，创造一些被称为“设计婴儿〃的孩子。 然而，这是一件好事吗?可能会有什么后果呢?哲学家、传学家和政府官员都己开始全力解决这 样的道德问题。我们必须想办法防止技术失控。这意味着我们要加以适当的控制，以确保基因 组编会朝着对我们有利的方向发展。如果没有适当的控制措施，基因组编可能会像失控的汽车 一样危险。  

There is still much to be explored and debated on the subject of genome editing. Despite the public argument over this technology, its possibilities have been creating much excitement throughout the entire medical community and beyond.Without doubt, genome editing is one of the greatest innovations in the history of science. Thank you for listening.  
在基因组編这个题上还有很多有待探索和讨论的问题。尽管公众对这项技术争论不一，但 是其可能性己经使医学界内外的人们感到非常兴奋。毫无疑问，基因组编是科学史上最伟大的 创新之一。谢谢大家的聆听。

**Acupuncture: magic needles 针灸:神针**  

One of the most famous Chinese medical treatments is the art of “ magic needles ", or Chinese acupuncture. It was developed long ago, perhaps as early as 2000 BCE. There is evidence that acupuncture dates back to the Stone Age, when stone tools called bian were used to press areas of the body.  
“神针〃，或称中国针灸，是最著名的中医疗法之一。它源于很久以前，也许早至公元前 2000年。有证据表明针灸始于石器时代，当时人们用一种叫作"貶〃的石器来接压身体部位。  

As acupuncture developed, the simple bian stones were replaced by stone needles. Eventually, metal needles began to appear and took the place of stone needles. These solid needles are made of different metals, such as gold and silver. Some acupuncturists today still use gold and silver needles, but the majority have now switched to stainless steel ones. In addition to the changes in material, the shapes of the needles have also changed over time. Originally, there were nine different kinds of needles, with variations in shape. Nowadays, the fine sharp needles that measure usually between 15 and 75 millimetres in length are still used, while most of the others have been replaced by more complex medical instruments.  
随着针灸的发展，简单的貶石被石针所取代。最终，金属开始出现并取代了石针。这些实 心针是由金和银等不同的金属制成的。一些针灸师如今仍在使用金针和银针，但大多数现在已 经改用不锈钢了。除了材料的变化，针的形状和使用方法也随着时问的推移而发生了改变。最 初，有九种不同的针，其形状和用途各不相同。如今，用于针负的针又细又尖，长度通常在 15到75米之间，而其他大多数都已被更复杂的医疗器械所取代。  

So what happens during a visit to the acupuncture clinic? First, the acupuncturist examines the patient, looking at the patient * s skin and tongue, listening to the sound of his or her voice and breathing, and smelling his or her breath. Then the acupuncturist asks some questions about the patient* s condition and feels his or her pulse. This is a particularly important step according to the energy theory behind acupuncture. The acupuncturist can check the pulse in three positions on each wrist, and every one of them is connected with a major body organ. By checking all the positions, the acupuncturist can find out which energy channel does not have enough energy.  
那么去针灸诊所治疗的时候会发生什么呢?首先，针灸师会检查病人，看病人的皮肤和舌 象，听他/地的声音和气息，还要闻他/她呼吸的味道。然后针灸师会问一些关于病情的问题， 并为病人把脉。根据背后的能量理论，这是一个特别重要的步骤。针灸师可以在每个手腕的三 个位置上进行把脉，每个位置都与身体的一个主要器官相连。通过检查所有的位置，针负师可 以发现哪个能量通道没有足够的能量。  

According to the results of the check-up, the acupuncturist then selects certain points on the body called acupuncture points. Needles are pushed into the skin at these points so that a health problem can be treated. Up to now, more than 360 acupuncture points have been identified, each linked to a different part of the body. Sometimes the needles are pushed into points near the body part affected by a disease, and sometimes into points that are not so close to it.  
接下来，针师根据把脉结果，会在身体上选择一些被称作穴位的点。在这些穴位上扎针可 以治疗健康问题。到目前为止，已有360多个针刺穴位被确认，每一个穴位都与身体的不同部 位相连。有时针扎的穴位靠近受疾病影响的身体部位，有时则不然。  

Over the years, acupuncture has been used to treat a wide variety of health problems, including severe pains, blood pressure issues, stomach discomfort, sports injuries and weight problems. And it has been used to treat more than just physical problems一acupuncturists have discovered that the treatment helps with mental problems like depression and anxiety too. Acupuncture has also been applied to treat people who abuse alcohol, tobacco or drugs.  
多年来，针灸被用于治疗各种各样的健康问题，包括严重的疼痛、血压问题、胃部不适、 运动损伤和肥胖问题。针灸不仅可以用于治疗生理疾病，针灸师还发现针灸对抑症和焦虑症等 心理疾病的治疗也有帮助。针负也被用于治疗酒、嗜毒、嗜烟的人群。  

How acupuncture actually works is not clearly understood. For example, there are different theories trying to explain how it eases pain, but no agreement has been reached. One theory explaining this phenomenon suggests that acupuncture blocks pain signals from reaching the brain. Another theory relates acupuncture to the production of a substance in the body which can reduce pain.  
针灸的实际工作原理尚不清楚。有不同的理论试图解释针灸如何减轻痛苦，但众说纷纭。 一种解释这一现象的理论认为，针灸阻止了疼痛信号到达大脑。另种理论认为，针灸让人体产 生了一种能减轻疼痛的物质。  

Despite the uncertainty about its medical basis, acupuncture has become a popular form of treatment. As a unique contribution of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture spread to many other Asian countries, such as Japan, as early as the 6th century. It was introduced to the West around the 16th century. In 2010, acupuncture was included in the UNESCO List of Intangible Cultural Heritage. Today, acupuncture is recognized as a symbol of traditional Chinese culture and has come into widespread use around the world. The World Health Organization recommends acupuncture as a good treatment for over 100 medical problems. While doubts about its safety have gradually disappeared, interest continues to grow.  
尽管针灸的医学基础还不确定，但它己经成为一种流行的治疗形式。针灸为中国传统医学 做出了独特贡献，传播到了许多其他亚洲国家，如早在6世纪的口本。针灸在17世纪被引入 西方。2010年，针灸被列入联合国教料文组织非物质文化遗产名录。如今，针灸被认为是中 国传统文化的象征，在世界各地广泛使用。世界卫生组织推荐使用针灸这种优良疗法来治疗 100多种医学疾病。人们对针灸安全性的怀疑逐渐减少，而对它的兴趣不断增加。

**Artificial intelligence: friendly or frightening?**  
**人工智能:友好还是可怕？**  

Imagine waking up one morning with the option of staying in bed and pressing a button to send a robot to do all the work for you. How cool that would be! It may seem like building castles in the airz but given the rate at which artificial intelligence, or Al, is being developed, in the future such dreams may actually come true.  
想象一下，某天早上醒来，你选择躺在床上，下一个按钮，让机器人来为你做所有的工作。那该多酷 啊!这看上去可能像建造空中楼一样(不切实际)，但是考虑到目前人工智能(AI)的发展速度，将来这样的梦想 很可能会真的实现。  

At the basic level, artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science that aims to develop intelligent machines. One of the essential aims of Al is to develop computer intelligence capable of learning from experience, adjusting to new inputs and performing tasks like humans. To achieve this aim, many approaches to creating true Al have been put forward, including “deep learningwhich enables a machine to improve its own performance by learning from the results of its previous actions. Deep-learning Al has the capacity to analyse massive amounts of data through multiple layers, imitating the complex networks of the human brain.  
基本上，人工智能是计算机科学的一个分支，旨在开发智能机器。人工智能基本的目标之一是开发计 算机智能，它能够从经验中学习适应新输入的信息并像人类一样执行任务。为了实现这一目标，人们提出 了许多创建真正的人工智能的方法，包括"深度学习〃，这种方法可以让机器通过学习先前行为的结果来提高 自身的性能。深度学习人工智能能够通过多层分析大量数据，模拟人类大脑的复杂网络。  

The dream of Al has been around for centuries, and the development of computers since the 1940s has finally made it a reality. Years before the term aartificial intelligence v was coined in the mid-1950s, the theory had been explored by Alan Turing, one of the pioneers in the field of computer science. However, for a long time, Al technology developed very slowly. A major breakthrough in Al came in 1997, when Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer, beat the world chess champion Garry Kasparov. Then in 2017, a computer program named AlphaGo defeated Ke Jie, arguably the best human Go player, which demonstrated a significant advance in deep-learning Al systems.  
人工智能的梦想己经存在了几个世纪，自20世纪40年代以来，计算机的发展终于使它成为现实。早 在“人工智能〃这个术语于20世纪50年代中期被创造出来的许多年前，计算机科学城的先驱之一艾伦•图灵 就己探索了人工智能理论。然而，在很长一段时间里，人工智能技术发展非常缓。1997年，人工智能才有 了重大突破，当时“深蓝〃击败了国际象棋世界冠军加里•卡斯帕罗夫。之后在2017年，一个叫作阿尔法围 棋的计算机程序打败了可能是人类最强的国棋棋手柯洁，这显示了深度学习人工智能系统的一大显著进展。  

Nowadays, Al is already being applied in many fields: finance, health care, natural language processing and art, to name but a few. From autonomous vehicles to domestic robots, from recommendation systems to computers writing novels, Al has an unlimited number of applications. Ordinary people are now using Al to get instant translations of text in foreign languages, and machines can recognize fingerprints and even faces.  
如今，工智能己经应用于许多领域:金融、医疗、自然语言处理和艺术，不一而足.从自动驾驶汽车到 家用机器人，从推荐系统到电脑写小说，人工智能有着无限的应用场景。老百姓现在正使用人工智能进行 外语文本的即时翻译，而且计算机可以识别指纹甚至人脸。  

In short, this technology is transforming the way we live. It is clear that we are at a turning point in history. With machines like AlphaGo now capable of thinking and learning from their mistakes, we are getting closer to the dividing line between humans and machines. The question is, where will all this lead? While Al enthusiasts promise us a bright future where intelligent robots will be working to our advantage, these undoubted benefits also bring concerns and fears. Could machines really develop human-like intelligence? And what would happen if they did? Would thinking machines work alongside humans or threaten the existence of humans? How would they be punished if they committed crimes or even murdered humans? As we become more and more dependent on computers, some scientists are urging us to think about the dangers posed by the advances in Al. Stephen Hawking, for example, warned, “The development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race.”  
简而言之，这一技术正在改变我们的生活方式。很明显，我们正处在历史的转折点上。现在随着像阿 尔法国棋这样能从错误中思考和学习的机器出现，人类和机器之间的分界线越来越不明显。问题是，这一 切将走向何方?人工智能的热烈支持者许诺智能机器人将为我们带来一个光明的未来，到时智能机器人将对 我们有利，但这些毋庸置疑的好处也带来了担忧和恐惧。机器真的能发展出类似人类的智能吗?如果真是这 样会发生什么?有思想的机器会和人类并肩作战，还是会成胁到人类的生存?如果他们犯罪甚至谋杀人类， 他们会受到怎样的惩罚?随着我们越来越依赖于电脑，一些科学家正敦促我们思考人工智能发展带来的危险。 例如，斯蒂芬•霍金曾警告说:“人工智能的全面发展可能意味着人类的终结。〃  

Apparently, such warnings demand our attention. We need to make sure that we will not fall victim to Al. We may still think it would be fantastic to relax all day and allow autonomous machines to do all the work for us一but perhaps we should not be too greedy and rather be careful what we wish for!  
显然，这样的警告需要我们的关注。我们需要确保我们不会成为人工智能的受害者。我们可能仍然会 想，让自动机器为我们做所有的工作，自己可以整天休闲，那样就太棒了。但也许我们不应该太贪婪，而 是对我们的愿望以谨慎的态度！

**Virtual reality**  
**虚拟现实**  

**SUSAN:** Frank, you * ve been working at the forefront of developments in virtual reality for many years. Can you tell us what virtual reality is and how it works?  
**苏珊:** 弗兰克，你己经在虚拟现实技术开发的最前沿工作了很多年。你能告诉我们什么是虚拟现实以及它的 工作原理吗？  

**FRANK:** Of course. The basic definition of VR lies in the name itself, which means “ reality that is not real" . When you wear a VR headset equipped with cameras and sensors, you are surrounded by three-D images, sounds and other sensory information, which creates a super-realistic effect called “presence” . Though you know the sensory information surrounding you is not real, part of your brain believes it is一and acts accordingly.  
**弗兰克:** 当然可以。虚拟现实的基本定义在于其名字本身，意思是“不真实的现实〃。当你戴上装有摄像头和 传感器的虚拟现实头盔时，你就被3D图像、声音和其他感官信息包围了，它们营造出一种被称为“在场〃的 超现实效果。虽然你知道你周围的感官信息不是真实的，但你大脑的一部分相信它是真实的，并作出相应 的反应。  

**SUSAN:** Thanks, Frank. Can you give some examples of the practical applications VR has?  
**苏珊:** 谢谢你，弗兰克。你能举例说明虚拟现实的实际应用吗？  

**FRANK:** I' d love to. There are a host of educational applications. Academic VR enables students to interact with others in a three-D environment. There are endless possibilities for the subject matter that can be created in a VR system. Imagine studying the solar system or the human body in a fully immersive environment. By delivering the content in a meaningful way, this new approach to learning manages to engage students* interest and enhance learning efficiency. The applications can be expanded to make it easier to visualize data such as engineering projects and a variety of other design developments. It' s pretty exciting!  
**弗兰克:** 我很乐意。（虚拟现实）在教育领域有大量应用。学校虚拟现实使学生能够在3D环境中与他人互动。 在虚拟现实系统中创造出的主题有无限可能。想象一下在一个完全沉浸式的环境中研究太阳系人体。这种 新的学习方法通过一种富有意义的方式来呈现内容，成功地吸引了学生的兴趣提高了学习效率。其应用范 围还可以得到扩展，从而更容易地使数据可视化，例如工程项目和各种其他的设计开发（的数据）。这是非 常令人兴奋的！  

**SUSAN:** This sounds like it has a lot of constructive applications. What about its uses for highly developed technical industries such as medicine?  
**苏珊:** 听起来虚拟现实有很多建设性的应用。那么虚拟现实在医药等高度发达的技术产业中的应用是怎么样 的？  

**FRANK:** Surgeons are already using robotic technology with VR to perform complex surgeries. What if I told you that doctors could create a virtual "twin " in order to practise delicate surgery before attempting it on the patient? This technology can be applied to train new surgeons; it also enables experts to test new techniques safely before trying them on human subjects. Treatments of anxiety and drug addiction are other valuable and cost-effective applications of VR.  
**弗兰克:** 外科医生己经在使用结合虚拟现实的机器人技术来完成复杂的手术了。如果我告诉你，医生可以创 造一个虚拟的患者“双胞胎〃，先进行精确的手术练习，然后才在病人身上做手术，你觉得怎么样？这项技术 可以用于培训新的外科医生，还能让专家在将新技术用于人体之前安全地进行测试。虚拟现实还可以用于 治疗焦虑和药物依赖，这些应用都极具价值和成本效益。  

**SUSAN:** That is amazing! It sounds like VR will be a life-changing technology as well as a life-saving one. How will it affect the different aspects of our everyday lives, such as entertainment, shopping and travelling?  
**苏珊:** 太棒了！听起来虚现实技术将会改变生活，也可拯生命。它将如何影响我们日常生活的方方面面呢？ 包括娱乐、购物和旅游等。  

**FRANK:** The entertainment industry is one of the most enthusiastic advocates of VR. Current game systems come with headsets so that players can enter virtual environments and play against either real or virtual opponents. It won' t be long before virtual museums and interactive three-D exhibitions become common. In shopping, you can look forward to being able to have your own virtual reality clone try on clothes and to see products with 360-degree views. Also, people who want to go on holiday will have the opportunity to take a virtual tour of several destinations before deciding where to go. In either case, this technology will help people make more informed choices. 弗兰克:娱乐业是虚现实最热衷的倡导者之一。目前的游戏系统都带有耳机，所以玩家可以进入虚拟环境， 与真实或虚拟的对手进行比赛。虚拟博物馆和交互式3D展览很就会普及。在购物方面，你可以期待虚拟试 衣和在360。視角下观看产品。此外，想去度假的人将有机会在决定去哪里之前进行几个目的地的虚拟旅行。 无论哪种情况，这项技术都将帮助人们做出更明智的选择。  

**SUSAN:** I can* t wait! However; as with any technology, there must be some barriers to the development of VR, I guess?  
**苏珊:** 我都迫不及待了!但是，我想，和任何技术一样，虚拟现实的发展一定也有一些因难，对吗？  

**FRANK:** It really boils down to three things—time, cost and technical limitations. We will need time to develop and fine-tune the hardware and software. The initial cost will discourage most people in the beginning but that should be fixed over time. The last issue is our own technical limitations. Just trying to figure out how to do what we want in terms of technology will prove challenging in some areas.  
**弗兰克:** 实际上就归结为三件事 时间、成本和技术局限。我们需要时间来开发和调整硬件和软件。 一开始的成本会让大多数人望而却步，但随着时间的推移，这一问题应该会得到解决。最后个问题是我们 自身的技术局限?在某些领城，仅仅是试图弄清楚如何从技术上实现我们想做的事情，都是具有挑战性的。 SUSAN: Considering there are so many challenges to deal with, are you still optimistic about the future of VR?  
**苏珊:** 考虑到还有很多难题需要解决，你对虚拟现实的未来还持乐观态度吗？  

**FRANK:** Sure. When talking about VR, we should keep in mind its quick rate of evolution. The possibilities seem endless. For example, 5G technology, with its potential to serve up more stable mobile connectivity at faster speed, will make it possible for people to enjoy a more immersive VR experience wherever they are. Indeed we are only limited by our imagination. What excites me the most is that young people today are digital citizens who are comfortable with technology. They* re well equipped to become part of a technological generation that will develop and use VR to do things we might think impossible today.  
**弗兰克:** 当然。当我们谈论虚拟现实时，我们应该记住它的速发展，其可能性似乎无穷尽也。例如，5G技术 有潜力以更快的速度提供更稳定的移动网连接，这可以让人们无论在哪都能享受更加沉浸式的虚拟现实体 验。事实上，我们只是受于我们的想象力。最让我激动的是，现在的年轻入都是数字公民，对科技感到很 自在。他们完全有能力成为技术时代的一员，开发并使用虚拟现实去做我们今天也许认为不可能的事情。  

**SUSAN:** Thank you, Frank. It all sounds wonderful.  
**苏珊:** 谢谢你，弗兰克。这一切听起来都很棒

**Canada - a land of diversity**  
**加拿大一一多样性之国**  

Canada is like a blooming flower; unfolding with breathtaking beauty and richness to win the heart of those who enjoy what it has to offer. It is a broad and beautiful country stretching from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. It is also one of the most ethnically diverse nations in the world with distinct cultures.  
加拿大就像一朵盛开的鲜花，绽放着令人惊叹的美丽和富饶，那些喜欢加拿大所提供的一 切的人因此非常喜欢这个国家。加拿大幅员辽阔、风景秀丽，从大西洋一直延伸到太平洋。它 也是世界上最具种族多样性的国家之一，有着丰富多样的文化。  

In the ten provinces and three territories which make up Canada, there is great diversity in geography. To the east of the Pacific coast rise the grand Rocky Mountains, which are home to high peaks and deep valleys carved by ice and water. Ancient, slow-moving glaciers hug the land and a huge variety of wildlife wanders the remote forests. The establishment of national parks makes many of these beautiful places protected areas for the public to visit and enjoy, such as Banff and Jasper National Parks. One truly unique scenic spot in Canada is the mighty Niagara Falls with water rushing over its edge in a splendid display of sights and sounds.  
组成加拿大的十个省和三个地区，地理环境多种多样。在太平洋海岸的东面，耸立着雄伟 的落基山脉，这里有高高的山峰和被冰与流水侵蚀而成的深谷。古老的、缓慢移动的冰川环绕 着这片土地，各种各样的野生动物漫步于偏远的森林。国家公因的建立使其中许多美丽的地方 成为供公众参观和游览的保护区，如班夫国家公园和贾斯珀国家公国。加拿大真正独一无二的 一处景点就是气势恢宏的尼亚加拉瀑布，水流从瀑布边倾泻而下，景色壮丽、声势浩大。  

Apart from its geographical diversity, Canada' s many rural areas and urban 好的，这是剩余部分的 Markdown 格式文本。

centers reflect the diversity of its residents. Some of Canada' s earliest settlers, who are thought to be ancestors of the indigenous peoples, crossed the Bering Strait by means of a land bridge from a place now known as Siberia. They settled on this vast land thousands of years ago. The first Europeans also started to settle in some of the eastern provinces centuries ago. Today, Canada reflects a vast combination of ethnic backgrounds. About one out of five people in Canada, s population is foreign-born. The major ethnic groups, for example, include the English, Scottish and French, while the minority groups include residents from Singapore and the Pacific Islands.  
除了其地理环境的多样性，加拿大的许多农村地区和城市中心也表现出其居民的多样性。 一些被认为是土著居民祖先的加拿大最早的定居者，是从现在被叫作西伯利亚的地方通过陆桥 跨过白令海峡（来到加拿大）的。他们几千年前在这片辽阔的土地上定居下来。第一批欧洲人也 在几个世纪前开始在东部的一些省份定居。如今，加拿大是许多种族的〃大熔炉〃。加拿大约五 分之一的人口是在国外出生的。例如，主要种族群体包括英格兰人、苏格兰人和法国人，而少 数族裔群体包括来自新加坡和太平洋岛屿的居民。  

This ethnic variety, in turn, brings about cultural diversity. Should you find yourself in one of these subcultures, languages, cuisine, architecture, art and music will define your encounter. For example, in Vancouver, a dynamic city with the highest percentage of Chinese Canadians in the country, you can participate in the celebrations of the Chinese New Year, or you may take tea in the Dr Sun Yat-Sen Classical Chinese Garden. In Montreal, one of the largest French-speaking cities in the world, you can sample the food with a typical French flavor and see the original buildings in the French style of architecture. Finally, if you are looking for something off the beaten track, you may visit Cape Breton Island in the province of Nova Scotia, where you can dance to fiddle tunes and enjoy the cultures and traditions of Celtic settlers. As you are exposed to diverse cultures, you may feel transported through time and space. Given these cultural differences, it comes as no surprise that Canada has been celebrating Multiculturalism Day since 2002.  
这种民族多样性又反过来造就了文化的多样性。如果你发现自己身处其中一种亚文化之 中，那么（它的）语言、饮食、建筑风格、艺术和音乐都会说明你邂逅的是何种文化。例如，温 哥华是一个充满活力的加拿大域市，其加拿大籍华人的比例在全国最高，在那里你可以参加庆 祝中国新年的活动，或者可以到中山公园喝茶。在世界最大的法语城市之 蒙特利尔，你 可以品尝到典型的法国风味的食物，还可以看到法式建筑风格的原始建筑。最后，如果你想做 一些打破常规的事情，你可以去新斯科舍省的布雷顿角岛，在那里你可以随着小提琴的曲调跳 舞，同时欣赏凯尔特移民的文化和传统。当接触到不同的文化时，你可能会感觉像是穿越了时 空。考虑到这些文化差异，加拿大从2002年起就一直在庆视多元文化日也就不足为奇了。  

From the towering mountain peaks to the depths of the forests to the urban centers, Canada' s geographical wonders, ethnic groups and their cultures make it a unique place to live and visit. Indeed, it has been consistently ranked by the United Nations as one of the best countries to live in, and visitors are always welcome!  
从高耸的山峰到森林的最深处再到域市中心，加拿大的地理奇观、种族和文化使其成为一 个独特的居住和游览之地。事实上，加拿大一直被联合国列为最适宜居住的国家之一，也一直 欢迎各地游客！

**An adventure in Africa**  

**30 June, Morocco 非洲历险 6月30日，摩洛哥**  

My parents and I had just driven down the narrow mountain road from Marrakesh, with all its sharp bends, and had finally arrived at Merzouga. Before us stretched the unending sand dunes that marked the beginning of the Sahara. A small boy walked past with a group of noisy goats as I took a long look at the yellow roadside sign that told us we were entering a 44fragile natural environment ** . I made a resolution to respect and protect this unique landscape while I was here. We set off, our vehicle quietly running over the sand and small stones. It wasn' t long before we were surrounded by enormous sand dunes towering above us on all sides. The wind was blowing grains of sand from the tops of the dunes, the sun was beating down hard and bright, and the sky was a deep shade of blue that I had never seen before. The wild beauty of the desert was about to reveal itself. There was not a plant to be seen. The desert appeared completely empty, which was calming and threatening at the same time. The colours of the dunes contrasted strikingly with the blue of the cloudless sky.  
我和父母刚从马拉什沿着狭窄的山路开车下来，一路都是急转弯，终于到达了梅尔祖卡。 我们面前绵延不绝的沙丘标志着撒哈拉沙漠的起点。我盯着路边的黄色指示牌看了很久，上面 写着我们正在进入一个"脆弱的自然环境〃，这时一个小男孩带着一群的山羊从我身边走了过 去。在这里的时候，我下定决心要尊重和保护这片独特的风景。我们出发了，我们的车在沙子 和小石块上悄然驶过。没过多久，我们就被四周高耸的巨大沙丘包围了。风吹起沙丘顶上的颗 颗沙粒，太阳猛烈而明亮地照射着，天空呈现出我以前从未见过的深蓝色。沙漠的野性之美就 要显露出来。这里看不见一株植物，看上去空荡荡的，让人平静的同时也充满了威胁。沙丘的 颜色与睛朗天空的蓝色形成鲜明的对比。  

Eventually, as the last rays of sunlight were falling on the sand, we arrived at our desert camp. Stars were already shining brightly in the darkening sky and it was getting cold with the approach of the night. Three camels, slowly chewing, were resting on their knees and watching our arrival with interest. "So, which one of you lucky animals will be my ride tomorrow " I said out loud as I grabbed my bag and headed towards the warm campfire. I was starving and rushed to put a steak on the barbecue.  
最后，当最后几缕阳光洒在沙子上时，我们到达了沙漠营地。星星已经在暮色苍茫的天空 中闪耀，随着夜幕的降临，天气越来越冷。三只骆驼呈跪姿在地上休息，慢慢地咀嚼着，饶有 兴趣地看着我们的到来。“那么，你们这些幸运的动物中，明天谁来驮我呢?〃我大声说着，抓 起我的包朝温暖的营火走去。我饿极了，赶紧在烤架上放了一块牛排。  

**3 July, Kenya**  
**7月3日，肯尼亚**  

A few days after our departure from the camp, our car was well and truly stuck in the mud. We were very near to our rest camp in Amboseli National Park located on the border of Kenya when my father; against my mother* s advice, decided to drive through a large pool of water that stretched across the dirt road. Two tall slim local people were standing by the roadside watching us with amusement. They must have realized that we were totally helpless, for after a few moments, they wandered over and pushed us free. My father smiled weakly and we drove on as my mother and I waved from the car window.  
离开营地几天后，我们的车完全陷进了泥里。当时，我们离位于肯尼亚边境的安博塞利国 家公国的休息营地非常近，父亲不听母亲的劝告，决定开车穿过一个横跨土路的大水坑。两个 又高又瘦的当地人站在路边，兴致勃勃地看着我们。他们一定知道我们孤立无援，因为过了一 会儿，他们走过来帮我们把车推了出来。父亲对他们淡淡地一笑，我和母亲从车窗向他们挥手, 然后我们继续上路了。  

We found a parking space next to our hut, which was round and made from brick. The walls, painted brilliant white, reflected the afternoon sun. There were five similar huts, all lined up facing Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. The mountain rose up over the plains before us. Tall grasses and trees dotted the plains, which were alive with the African wildlife we had come to see. Giraffes, with their long necks, were pulling leaves from the highest branches. In the distance, elephants were eating grass, ears flapping lazily as they moved slowly over the plains. I had never seen anything like this before. It was indeed the greatest show on the Earth.  
我们的小屋是圆形的、用砖砌成的，我们在屋旁找到了一个停车位。墙壁漆成明亮的白色, 反射着午后的阳光。那里有五座类似的小屋，都排成一排，面向非洲最高的山脉一一乞力马扎 罗山。这座山在我们面前的平原上拔地而起。高高的草和树木点缀着平原，非洲的野生动物使 平原生机勃勃，我们正是为了看它们而来。长颈鹿凭借着长长的脖子，从最高的树枝上采摘树 叶。远处，大象正在吃草，它们慢慢地走过平原时，耳朵懒洋洋地拍打着。我以前从没见过这 样的场景。这的确是地球上最精彩的演出。  

We got out of the car; carrying our suitcases and boxes of food into the hut. I placed ham sandwiches, sausages and a bunch of bananas on a small wooden table. I returned to the car and fetched more possessions. It was then that I noticed a small grey monkey sitting on a tree a few metres away and eating a banana. " So cute," I thought to myselt until I realized it was my banana that he was eating! He was looking at me intently as he enjoyed the final mouthful. I was sure he was saying, "Thank you." "You' re welcome/* I replied.  
我们下了车，拿着手提箱和一盒盒食物进了小屋。我把火腿三明治、香肠和一串香蕉放在 一张小木桌上。（然后）我回到车上，又拿了些东西。就在这时，我注意到一只灰色的小猴子坐 在几米开外的树上吃香蕉。“太可爱了，"我心想着，后来才意识到他吃的正是我的香蕉!他专 注地看着我，享受着最后一口香蕉。我确信他在说〃谢谢〃。“不客气，〃我答道。

**Life on a space station**  
**在空间站的生活**  

Living in space is every would-be astronaut* s dream. My six-month stay on a space station has come to an end, and it has been a challenging but magical adventure. I bet you* d love to know what daily life is like up in space and how it differs from that on the Earth—the low gravity definitely makes ordinary things strange!  
在太空生活是每一个想要成为宇航员的人的梦想。我在空间站为期六个月的驻扎已经结束 了，这是一场充满挑战但又神奇的冒险。我敢说你想知道太空中的日常生活是什么样的，还想 知道那与地球上的生活有什么不同一一低重力肯定会让平常之事变得奇怪！  

The strangeness of living in space is apparent from the moment we sleep. Due to the near absence of gravity in space, we have to attach ourselves so that we don' t float around. We usually sleep in private quarters, which are more like large cupboards, or in sleeping bags attached to the walls or the ceiling. It* s strange that we try to sleep with no pressure against our back, but the unusual beds don' t bother us any more. After about eight hours of sleep, we start our day of work.  
从我们睡觉的那一刻起，在太空生活的奇特之处就显而易见了。由于太空中几乎没有重力， 我们必须把自己固定起来，这样才不会四处飘浮。我们通常睡在更像大橱柜的私人空冋内或固 定在墙上或天花板上的睡袋里。我们努力在背部没有压力的情况下睡觉，这有些奇怪，但这些 不寻常的床不再使我们烦恼了。在大约8小时的睡眠后，我们开始一天的工作。  

The routine tasks that occupy most of the day are demanding, but they can also be extremely rewarding. Our main mission is to conduct scientific research. We need to evaluate the effects of low gravity on animals and plants. Creatures such as mice, fish and mosquitoes have also been sent to the station! In a low-gravity environment, we can learn more about changes in cells and microorganisms under the microscope. As well as doing these biological experiments, we carry out experiments in other research fields. I have been working on one experiment which locates and tracks lightning over large regions of the Earth. Hopefully, it will cast new light on the Earth' s climate and lead to better lightning protection. With so much going on, the space station needs a lot of maintenance, so we constantly check support systems and do some cleaning.  
占据了一天中大部分时间的日常事务要求很高，但也非常有意义。我们的主要任务是进行 科学研究。我们需要评估低重力（环境）对动植物的影响。老鼠、鱼和蚊子等生物也被送到了空 间站!在低重力环境下，我们可以在显微镜下更多地了解细胞和微生物的变化。除了做这些生 物实验，我们还进行其他研究领城的实验。我一直尝试定位并追踪地球上大片区域的闪电。希 望它能让我们进一步了解地球气候，并带来更好的避雷措施。空冋站上同时进行着这么多事情， 需要经常维护，所以我们经常检查支持系统并做些清洁工作。  

The most challenging work takes place when we need to perform tasks outside the space station, such as testing new equipment, monitoring scientific experiments or repairing the space station. In the circumstances, it* s time for a spacewalk. First, we put on our spacesuits, which allow us to breathe in space and protect us from exposure to the cold and radiation. Then we head out, and sometimes perform tasks for hours at a time, with the beautiful Earth visible below. Splendid as the view of the Earth is, spacewalking is not as exciting as you might think. It' s probably the most dangerous work, with potential risks such as electric shocks. That* s why every spacewalk is carefully planned.  
最具挑战性的工作出现在我们需要在空冋站外面执行任务的时候，比如测试新设备、监测 科学实验或修复空间站。在这种情况下，就要进行太空行走了。首先，我们穿上航天服，这样 我们才能在太空中呼吸、给身体保温并防止辐射。然后我们走到空间站外面，有时执行任务要 好几个小时，可以看到脚下就是美丽的地球。虽然地球的景色很壮丽，但太空行走并不像你们 可能想象的那么令人兴奋。这可能是最危险的工作，有潜在的风险，比如触电。这就是为什么 每次太空行走都是精心计划好的。  

In view of the low-gravity environment, eating is also different in space. Most food is dried or freeze-dried. It* s a luxury to eat fresh food, because fresh produce such as fruit and vegetables can only be delivered to the space station from the Earth every couple of months. Salt and pepper are only in liquid form, so that they will not float away and block the air pipes. However; liquids can' t be easily controlled in space. We must drink water or any other liquids out of a bag through a thin tube of plastic. Furthermore, to keep our body healthy, we must ensure a balanced supply of nutrients by taking pills.  
鉴于低重力环境，在太空吃饭也有所不同。大多数食物都是脱水的或冷冻干燥的。吃到新 鲜食物是-•种奢侈，因为像水果和蔬菜这样的新鲜农产品只能每隔几个月从地球运送到空间 站。盐和胡椒只能是液体形态，这样它们就不会飘走并堵塞空气管道。但是，液体在太空中不 容易控制。我们必须通过一根细细的塑料管来喝袋子中的水或任何其他液体。此外，为了保持 身体健康，我们必须通过吃药来确保营养的均衡供应。  

Spending some time in the gym is of vital importance to astronauts* health. Did you know that in just five months, astronauts could lose a significant amount of muscle and bone mass? Considering these negative effects low gravity has on the human body, we discipline ourselves to do at least two hours of exercise every day. Exercise in space is not your average workout. We have to be tied onto specially designed exercise equipment to stop ourselves from floating around.  
花些时间健身对宇航员的健康至关重要。你知道在仅仅5个月的时间里宇航员就可能会失 去相当多的肌肉量和骨量吗?考虑到低重力对人体的这些负面影响，我们严格要求自己每天至 少锻炼两个小时。在太空中锻炼跟平常的锻炼不一样。我们必须被绑在特殊设计的运动器材上， 以防止自己四处飘浮。  

During our leisure time, there* s nothing we like more than to sit back with the rest of the crew and watch our remarkable planet go by, taking pictures for our family and friends back home. As the space station travels at a speed of about 17,500 miles per hour; we get to see the sunrise every 90 minutes. In these precious moments, all the challenges of life in space seem worth it.  
在闲暇时间，我们最喜欢做的就是和其他宇航员一起舒服地坐下来，看着我们非凡的星球 从身边经过，为在地球上的家人和朋友拍些照片。由于空间站以每小时约17, 500英里的速度 运行，每隔90分钟我们就能看到一次日出。在这些珍贵的时刻，太空生活的所有挑战似乎都 是值得的。

**Why we explore**  
**我们为什么要探索**  

In 1969, when Neil Armstrong first landed on the Moon, many people thought that soon we would be regularly visiting other planets in our solar system and would even dare to travel beyond it. This is clearly not the case. The reality is that space exploration is extremely difficult and dangerous, can take a very long time and costs a huge amount of money. Some people believe that while space exploration expands our understanding of the universe, it is a waste of the public purse and does nothing to enhance the quality of our lives here on the Earth. Why do we continue to explore space, then?  
1969年，当尼尔•阿姆斯特朗首次登上月球时，许多人认为不久我们就会经常访问太阳 系中的其他行星，甚至敢于到太阳系之外旅行。事实显然不是这样。现实情况是，太空探索极 其困难且充满了危险，需耗费大量的时间和资金。有些人认为，太空探索虽然拓展了我们对宇 宙的认识，但也浪费了公共资金，而且对提高人类在地球上的生活质量没有任何帮助。那么， 我们为什么还要继续探索太空呢？  

It is in our nature to explore. From the very early days of human life on the Earth,our curiosity about the unknown has kept us adventuring into new places. We long to visit thick and wild forests, climb vast mountain ranges, and cross deep oceans. We desire to explore the furthest frontier of all—space. As Stephen Hawking once said, 44 Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist. Be curious/* That we are fascinated by the sky is evident in ancient tales from around the world, such as that of Chang* e. While space exploration is a reality, we remain curious about the mysteries of the universe. With each space mission comes greater insight, thus motivating us to continue along the same path of adventure.  
探索是我们的天性。从人类在地球上的早期生活开始，我们对未知的好奇就直促使我们去 新的地方探险。我们渴望探访茂密的原始森林、攀登雄伟的山脉、穿越深邃的海洋。我们渴望 探索最遥远的边界一一太空。正如斯蒂芬•霍金曾经所说：“记得抬头仰望星空，而不是着脚 下。试着弄明白自己看到的东西，并思索宇宙存在的理由。保持一颗好奇之心。”从世界各地 古代的故事中就能明显看出我们对天空的痴迷，比如嫦娥的故事。虽然太空探索是现实，但我 们仍然对宇宙的奥秘感到好奇。每一次太空任务都会带来更深刻的认识，从而激励我们继续沿 着同样的冒险之路前进。  

The results of these space investigations have made major contributions to an understanding of the origin, evolution, and likely future of the universe, such as planets, stars, and all other forms of matter and energy.  
Exploring space helps address fundamental questions about our place in the universe and the history of our solar system. It is through our research into space that we have confirmed that the Earth is round and that it orbits the Sun. As we learn more about the universe, we may one day answer the question whether there is life on other planets.  
这些太空调査的结果对了解宇宙的起源、演变和可能的未来，如行星、恒星和所有其他形 式的物质和能量，做出了重大贡献。探索太空有助于解答关于我们在宇宙中的位置以及太阳系 的历史的基本问题。正是通过我们对太空的研究，我们得以证实地球是圆的，并且是绕太阳运 动的。随着我们对宇宙了解得更多，有一天我们可能会弄清其他行星上是否有生命这个问题。  

With technologies first researched and developed for space exploration, we can solve some of the big problems facing mankind, making our lives safer and easier. One of these is earthquake shock absorbers. Shock absorbers originally applied to the space shuttle launch have also been set up in the cities with a high frequency of earthquakes in order to protect buildings and save lives. Some technologies need further research to better solve real-life problems. For example, liquid hydrogen is a clean alternative energy source that is used widely as rocket fuel, and it is likely that hydrogen fuel cell vehicles will be mass-produced and launched in the near future. These scientific and technological advances can provide benefits to societies on the Earth in many areas including health, energy and information technology. This should be a strong motive for continuing to explore space.  
有些技术最初是为太空探索而研发的，我们可以用其解决人类面临的一些重大问题，使我 们的生活更安全、更轻松。其中之一就是地震减震器。最初应用于航天飞机发射中的减震器也 己安装在地震频发的城市，以保护建筑物和拯教生命。为了更好地解决现实生活中的问题，有 些技术还需要进一步研究。例如，液氢是一种清洁的替代能源，被广泛用作火箭燃料，很可能 在不久的将来氢燃料电池汽车被大量生产并投入使用。这些科学和技术进步可在医疗卫生、能 源和信息技术等许多领域为地球上的群体带来好处。这应该是继续探索太空的一个强烈的动 机。  

Although space exploration demands huge investment, the space industry can actually bring great economic value. It has been calculated that the global space economy is increasing by billions of dollars every year. At the same time, space exploration can provide a variety of career opportunities for young people. Jobs in the space industry go far beyond the astronauts that receive widespread media coverage. There are many support staff on the ground, such as engineers, mechanics and research assistants.  
虽然太空探索需要巨大的投资，但航空业实际上可以带来巨大的经济价值。据计算，全球 太空经济以每年数十亿美元的速度增长。同时，太空探索可以为年轻人提供多种就业机会。航 空业的工作远不只是受到媒体广泛报道的宇航员。在地面上有许多做支持工作的员工，如工程 师、技工和研究助理。  

Moreover, the amazing work these people do can provide education and inspiration for the next generation. For me personally, this is by far the biggest reason for humanity to explore space. Such wonders as a space shuttle launch or astronauts walking on the Moon are incredibly exciting and inspiring to witness, and it can be these moments that shape children, s lives forever and motivate them to become the scientists and engineers of the future. It is this kind of inspiration that keeps our thirst for knowledge alive and ensures that advances in space exploration and many other fields will continue to be made. When you have seen a man walk on the Moon, you grow up believing that anything is possible!  
此外，这些人所从事的了不起的工作可以教育和鼓舞下一代。对我个人来说，这是迄今为 止人类探索太空的最大原因。能见证像航天飞机发射或宇航员在月球上行走这样的奇迹是极其 令人激动和鼓舞人心的。正是这些瞬冋将长久地影响孩子们的一生，激励他们成为未来的科学 家和工程师。正是这种鼓励使我们保持着对知识的渴望，并确保了太空探索和许多其他领域的 不断进步。如果你见过一个人在月球上行走，你长大后就会相信一切皆有可能！

**Sailing the oceans**  
**航海**  

**Zheng He**  
**郑和**  

In the summer of 1405, Zheng He, one of China' s greatest explorers, set sail from Taicang on his first voyage. A fleet of over 200 ships navigated the blue seas, with almost 28,000 people on board, which was a splendid scene. It would take 500 years before a larger fleet sailed the seas. According to some records, the largest ships were over 140 metres in length, demonstrating the advanced technology and special skills used in constructing ships.  
1405年夏天，郑和中国最伟大的探险家之一，从太仓启航，开始了他的第一次航行。一 支拥有200多艘船只的舰队在蓝色的海洋上航行，船上有近28, 000人，一派壮丽的景象。直 到500年后，才有更大的舰队在海上航行。根据一些记录，最大的船只长度超过140米，展示 出当时用于建造船舶的先进技术和特殊技艺。  

Between 1405 and 1433, on behalf of the Ming Dynasty, Zheng He made a total of seven voyages. His ships were loaded with china, silk, tea and other treasures as gifts for foreign rulers, and the fleet paid friendly visits to more than 30 countries and regions. He even sailed as far as the east coast of Africa. As they sailed, the navigators took compass readings, kept logs of their voyages and charted the coast. Later the detailed maps became Zheng He' s Navigation Map.  
1405年至1433年间，郑和代表明朝共出航七次。他的船上满载着瓷器、丝绸、茶叶和其 他珍宝作为礼物送给外国统治者，舰队对30多个国家和地区进行了友好访问。他甚至远航到 非洲东海岸。当他们航行时，领航员记录罗盘读数、记录航行日志并绘制海岸图。后来这些祥 细的地图就成了《郑和航海图》。  

Zheng He' s seven voyages had a far-reaching impact on China and its neighbours. In the countries and regions where Zheng He set foot, legends have been passed on about this great explorer. Zheng He* s efforts helped develop and strengthen harmonious relations with these countries and regions, exposing foreign people to Chinese culture, and allowing the Chinese to better understand overseas lands.  
郑和七下西洋对中国及其周边国家产生了深远的影响。在郑和到过的国家和地区，关于这 位伟大探险家的传说代代相传。郑和的努力有助于发展和加强与这些国家和地区的和谐关系， 让外国人接触中国文化，也让中国人更好地了解国外。  

For many years, some historians dismissed the records of these voyages as legends. The final proof came when an enormous shipyard was discovered in Nanjing, where the fleet had been built. Zheng He' s accomplishments are now widely acknowledged, and he is remembered as one of China * s most influential explorers.  
多年来，一些历史学家把这些航海记录当作传说而不予理会。最终的证据是在南京发现了 一个巨大的造船厂，这支舰队就是在那里建造而成。郑和的成就现在得到广泛认可，他也作为 中国最具影响力的探险家之一被世人铭记。  

**Christopher Columbus**  
**克里斯托弗-哥伦布**  

Those who make great discoveries must often overcome many challenges along the way—as was the case with the explorer Christopher Columbus. Columbus was born in a port city of Italy in 1451. As a teenager; he loved sailing, and he showed great interest in geography, which inspired him to begin his career as a seaman.  
那些得伟大发现的人必然要在这一过程中经常克服许多挑战一一就像探险家克里斯托 弗•哥伦布那样。哥伦布于1451年出生在意大利的一个港口城市。十几岁的时候，他就喜欢 航海，对地理表现出了极大的兴趣，这促使他开始了自己的海员生涯。  

Columbus insisted on searching for a direct sea route to the East Indies by sailing across the Atlantic Ocean. After continuous attempts, he received financial support from the King and Queen of Spain. On 3 August 1492, he departed from Spain with three ships carrying about 90 crewmen. The journey was full of challenges: it took longer than expected, they faced a shortage of food, and one of the ships was leaking badly, which put everyone on this ship in grave danger. The men on board were in panic. Regardless of all the challenges, Columbus managed to keep everyone out of danger with his knowledge and bravery across the ocean. Finally, on 12 October, the crew spotted land in the distance. Columbus called the natives living on the islands Indians because he was convinced that he was in the East Indies. However; the shores they had reached were of the Caribbean, not the East Indies.  
哥伦布坚持通过横渡大西洋寻找通往东印度群岛的直接航线。经过不断的努力，他得到了 西班牙国王和王后的资金支持。1492年8月3日，他带着三艘船离开西班牙，船上约有90名 船员。这趟旅程充满了挑战:花费的时间比预期的要长，他们面临着食物短缺，还有其中一艘 船严重漏水，这让这艘船上的所有人都陷入了极大的危险之中。船上的人都惊惶失措。不顾所 有挑战，哥伦布设法凭借自己的知识和勇敢确保每个人都平安越过了海洋。最后，在10月12 日，船员发现了远处的陆地。哥伦布把居住在这些岛屿上的土著人称为印第安人，因为他确信 自己是到了东印度群岛。然而，他们到达的海岸是加勒比海岸，不是东印度群岛。  

Between 1493 and 1504, Columbus found more land over the course of his three subsequent voyages. The major contribution of this great explorer is that he “ discovered " the New World. His discovery inspired explorers such as Captain James Cook to explore and discover more vast areas of the world. His voyages opened a new chapter of the Age of Exploration, a period which witnessed many important geographical findings. This period also allowed for an international exchange of ideas and cultures.  
1493年至1504年间，哥伦布在随后的三次航行中发现了更多的陆地。这位伟大的探险家 的主要贡献是他“发现” 了新大陆。他的发现启发了詹姆斯库克船长等探险家去探索和发现世 界上更广阔的地区。他的航行开启了大航海时代的新篇章，这一时期见证了许多重要的地理发 现。这一时期也使思想和文化的国际交流成为可能。

**Hell comes to pearl harbor**  
**地狱降临珍珠港**  

It was Sunday, December 7,1941. As usual, the wake-up call came at 5:45 a.m. The men aboard the warship USS Arizona stretched and rubbed their eyes. Seaman Russell Warriner was awakened by Quartermaster Louis Conter. Russell made his bed and helped clean the huge, shared room. The men went to the washroom, dressed in their uniforms and sat down to breakfast. It looked like it would be a normal day on board the ship.  
那是1941年12月7日，星期天。和往常一样，起床号在早上5点45分响起。美国“亚 利桑那号”战列舰上的人伸了伸懒腰，揉了揉眼睛。军需官路易•孔泰叫醒了海员拉塞尔-沃 里纳。拉塞尔整理了床铺，还帮忙打扫了这个巨大的共用房间。人们走进盥洗室，穿上制服， 然后坐下来吃早饭。看起这将是船上平常的一天。  

But nobody ate their breakfast: at that moment, there was a huge crashing sound from above. The ship shook violently and the men looked at each other in horror. Above their heads, hundreds of Japanese planes circled like eagles. They were diving down to drop bombs on Pearl Harbor. The scream of their engines was deafening. As bombs thundered all around, clouds of black smoke rose into the sky and hung over the sea. Russell felt his blood freeze, but he quickly came to himself and rushed up to the deck. Moments later; a bomb hit the USS Arizona and Russell was thrown more than 100 meters across the ship. He suffered serious burns on his hands, arms and legs, and watched many of his friends die.  
但是没有人吃早饭:就在那时，上面传来一声巨响。船剧烈地摇晃着，船员们惊恐地面面 相觑。在他们头顶上，数百架日本飞机像鹰一样盘旋，它们俯冲下来把炸弹投到珍珠港。发动 机发出的轰鸣声震耳欲聋。炸弹在各处炸响，黑烟形成云，升上空并笼平着大海。拉塞尔觉得 自己的血都凝固了，但他立马反应过来，冲到甲板上。片刻之后，一枚炸弹击中了美国“亚利 桑那号”战舰，拉塞尔被炸到100多米开外。他的手、胳膊和腿被严重烧伤，眼睁睁地看着许 多朋友死去。  

Louis, meanwhile, also standing on the deck, was lucky not to be thrown into the sea. With only minor injuries, he was able to help others who were severely burnt and in terrible pain. After receiving the order to abandon ship, Louis saved more men from the water; dragging them into the lifeboat. In the chaos and confusion after the attack, the US Navy sent a message to his family that Louis had been killed in the attack. Luckily, he was able to get in touch with them before the message arrived. Despite his remarkable actions, Louis did not think that he was a hero. "The heroes are the ones that gave their lives that day," he said.  
此时，路易也站在甲板上，很幸运没有被炸进海里。他只受了轻伤，还能帮助那些严重烧 伤、病苦不堪的人。在接到弃船的命令后，路易从水中救出了更多的人，把他们拖上了救生艇。 发生袭击后一片混乱，美国海军给路易的家人发送了条消息，称路易已经在袭击中丧生。幸运 的是，他在这则消息到家之前已经与家人取得了联系。路易虽然做出了非凡的举动，但他并不 认为自己是英雄。“英雄是那些在那天献出生命的人，”他说。  

Russell was saved from the water; but he was badly burnt, bleeding heavily. Fortunately, he was taken to hospital and survived. For many years, Russell refused to talk about what happened that morning, describing it simply as " hellHis wife Elsa said, " When he opened up later on, he always mentioned the horror of it."  
拉塞尔被从海里救了出来，但他被严重烧伤，大量出血。幸运的是，他被送医院并活了下 来。多年来，拉塞尔一直拒绝谈论那天早上发生的事情，只是简单地把它描述为“地狱”。他 的妻子埃尔莎说：“后来他敞开心扉时，总是提到那次袭击多么可怕。”  

Louis and Russell would never forget the terrible scene of the attack, but they were fortunate enough to be among the few survivors from the Arizona. Nobody had expected the bombing. Japan had hatched a plot to launch a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor; so the attack began without warning and without declaring war on the United States. The attack destroyed nearly 20 American ships and over 180 airplanes. In total, more than 2,000 American people were killed and over 1,000 others were wounded that day. More than 1,000 people aboard the Arizona lost their lives. Out of 37 sets of brothers, Russell and his brother were the only full pair to survive the attack.  
路易和拉塞尔永远不会忘记受袭击时的可怕场面，但他们足够幸运，是“亚利桑那号”的 少数幸存者。没有人料到会有空袭。日本策划了突袭珍珠港的阴谋，所以对这次袭击没有发出 任何警告，也没有对美国宣战。这次击毁了近20艘美国军舰和180多架飞机。当天共有超过 2, 000名美国人死亡，1, 000多人受伤。“亚利桑那号”上有1, 000多人丧生。在37对兄 弟中，拉塞尔和他的兄弟是唯一存下来的完整的一对。  

The surprise attack came as a great shock to the whole nation. The next day, President Roosevelt delivered his famous Pearl Harbor Speech, in which he described December 7 as "a date which will live in infamy" and asked that the US Congress declare war on Japan. In response to the attack and the president' s address, the United States joined the Second World War.  
这次突然袭击使美国全国大为震惊。第二天，罗斯福总统发表了著名的《珍珠港演说）， 他称12月7日为“一个耻辱的日子”，并要求美国国会对日本宣战。为了回应这次袭击和总 统的演讲，美国加入了第二次世界大战。  

Today, the USS Arizona lies where it sank: in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Its location is marked with a memorial shaped like a bridge, which crosses the ship* s sunken remains. Each year; more than two million people visit the memorial. They come to see the shadow of the ship at the bottom of Pearl Harbor; to learn about the attack, to show respect for those who had lost their lives in the attack and to pray for world peace. Although about eight decades has passed, the attack on Pearl Harbor; one of the darkest episodes in American history, will never be forgotten.  
今天，美国“亚利桑那号”战列舰仍在其沉没的地方:太平洋的中央。人们在它所在的位 置建了一座桥状的纪念馆，横跨沉船的残骸。每年都有200多万人参观这个纪念馆。游容来到 珍港看那艘船在海底的影子，了解袭击的情况，向那些在袭击中丧生的人表示致意，并为世界 和平祈祷。尽管过去了约80年，但美国历史上最黑暗的事件之一珍珠港事件永远不会被人们 遗忘。

**Heritage in danger**  
**濒危遗产**  

Welcome, everybody. It' s wonderful to be here. Before we begin, I want to ask you: have you ever been awed by natural wonders? Have you ever been fascinated by human civilization? If so, you might already understand why UNESCO is fighting to preserve sites of cultural and natural importance to mankind. I have the belief that some of you have heard about UNESCO heritage sites or maybe even visited one! There are currently around 1,100 sites in more than 160 countries worldwide. Unfortunately, they face a variety of dangers and many of them are in urgent need of protection. Let* s look at some specific issues.  
欢迎大家！很高兴来到这里。在我们开始之前，我想问大家一个问题:您曾为自然奇观惊 叹过吗?您曾为人类文明感到着迷吗?如果是这样的话，您可能已经明白为什么联合国教科文组 织正在努力保护对人类具有重要意义的文化和自然遺址。我相信你们中有些人听说过联合国教 科文组织目录中的文化遗产，甚至可能参观过某一个遗址！目前，在全球160多个国家，有大 约1100处文化遗产。不幸的是，这些文化遗产面临着各种危险，其中许多亟须保护。让我们 来看看一些具体的问题。  

Heritage sites are at risk from natural forces. The long-term natural forces, such as wind, water and temperature, can gradually wear down heritage sites. For instance, the Great Pyramid of Giza is now several metres shorter than it was originally. Natural disasters, the sudden and powerful natural forces, can lead to the destruction of heritage sites: in 2003, a terrible earthquake shook south-eastern Iran and ruined large parts of the city of Bam, an incredible UNESCO cultural heritage site.  
自然力威胁着文化遗产。长期的自然力，如风、水和温度，都会逐渐侵蚀这些遗产。例如， 吉萨大金字塔现在比原来矮了好几米。自然灾害，即突然而强大的自然也可能破坏遗产：2003 年，伊朗东南部发生了一场可怕的地震，摧毁了大部分巴姆城堡，巴姆城堡是一处极好的联合 国教科文组织文化遗产。  

Another big danger is human activities. Wars can cause a great deal of damage to both cultural and natural heritage sites. Sometimes, amazing ancient clay sculptures and buildings are accidentally destroyed by missile attacks during periods of violence. In some conflict areas where civil wars often break out, fighters have even destroyed heritage sites on purpose.  
另一个重要的危险因素是人类活动。战争会对文化和自然产造成很大的破坏。有时，令人 惊叹的古代泥塑和建筑会在暴力活动期间意外地被导弹摧毁。在一些经常爆发内战的冲突地 区，武装分子甚至蓄意破坏遗产。  

Meanwhile, World Heritage status may give rise to a series of problems. One of the problems is the flood of tourists. Millions of tourists travel to UNESCO World Heritage Sites every year, so it is only natural that the sites suffer a bit of wear and tear. The temples of Angkor in Cambodia are typical examples of unique architecture. Every day, thousands of tourists climbing up the narrow stone steps are wearing down these ancient buildings and the long-term consequences could lead to irreparable destruction of the internal structure.  
同时，世界文化遗产的重要地位也可能引发一系列问题。其中一个问题就是大量的游客。 每年有数百万的游客前往联合国教科文组织世界遗产地旅游，所以这些遗产地遭受一些磨损和 破坏是很自然的事。柬埔寨吴哥的庙宇是独特建筑的典型代表。每天，成千上万的游客爬上狭 窄的石阶，磨损了这些古老的建筑，且长此以往可能给内部结构带来无法修复的破坏。  

Due to human population growth, the demand for production and consumption of goods increases. Widespread development puts our cultural and natural heritage sites in danger. Many heritage sites are even at risk of being lost forever. Take the Historic Centre of Vienna in Austria as an example. The city has been recognized as the musical capital of Europe since the 16th century, home to the likes of Mozart and Beethoven. It is now on the List of World Heritage in Danger due to high-rise construction projects in central Vienna.  
由于人口的增长，对产品的生产和消费的需求增加。广泛的发展将我们的文化和自然遗产 置于危险境地。许多文化遗产甚至面临永远消失的危险。以奥地利的维也纳历史中心为例。自 16世纪以来，维也纳这座城市就被视为欧洲的音乐之都，莫扎特和贝多芬等人都曾在此处居 住。由于维也纳市中心的高层建筑项目，维也那历史中心现在已被列入《世界濒危遗产名录》。  

Such dangers can have disastrous outcomes not only for the sites themselves, but also for people. For instance, the Great Barrier Reef off the north-east coast of Australia is a natural heritage site in danger. Due to high seawater temperatures caused by global warming, a large amount of coral is killed and parts of the reef are seriously affected, which harms its fragile natural ecology. As well as being home to a wide diversity of ocean species, the reef can boost tourism and fishing in the local area, providing many job opportunities. It also helps protect the coastline against waves and floods. If the reef disappears, many people' s lives and possibly even their homes will suffer greatly.  
这些危险不仅会对遗址本身，也会对人们造成灾难性的后果。例如，澳大利亚东北海岸的 大堡礁是一处面临危险的自然遗产。由于全球变暖导致海水温度升高，大量珊瑚死亡，大堡礁 的部分区域受到严重影响，也破坏了其脆弱的自然生态。大堡不仅是众多海洋物种的家园，还 能促进当地旅游业和渔业的发展，提供了许多就业机会。它还有助于保护海岸线免受海浪和洪 水的侵袭。如果珊瑚礁消失了，许多人的生活甚至他们的家都将遭受巨大的损失。  

Heritage protection is at the top of the agenda for the benefit of all mankind. The more we acknowledge the outstanding universal value of our heritage sites, the more likely we are to treat them with respect. These sites are the great wonders of our world and tell the story of human civilization. We all share a joint responsibility to protect and preserve them, not just for ourselves, but for future generations. If your heart breaks like mine at the thought of our irreplaceable heritage being lost forever, please take action. If you* re interested, please look at our website and participate in any way you can! Thank you.  
遗产保护是造福全人类的头等大事。我们越能认识到遗产的突出普世价值，我们就越有可 能尊重它们。这些遗产地是我们世界的伟大奇迹，讲述着人类文明的故事。我们有共同责任来 保护和保留它们，不是为了我们自己，也是为了我们的子孙后代。如果想到我们不可替代的世 界遗产将永远失去，你也会像我一样心碎的话，请采取行动。如果你有兴趣，请浏览我们的网 站，并以任何可能的方式参与其中！感谢！

**Follow the Silk Road**  
**跟随“丝绸之路”**  

Covering vast distances and an astonishing variety of landscapes, the Silk Road was a network of ancient trade routes that extended from East Asia all the way to the Mediterranean. A key section of the extensive Silk Road network is the Chang* an-Tianshan Corridor; which stretches over a distance of around 5,000 kilometres through China, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, covering a total of 8,700 kilometres of trade routes. The three countries jointly pursued an application for UNESCO World Heritage status. They submitted the proposal which contained detailed research on the 33 sites along the corridor. This made history in its own way as the first successful multinational World Heritage application——and it seems to be only the beginning of the road for the Silk Road, as other countries are also planning World Heritage applications for other sections of the network.  
“丝绸之路”是一个古代贸易路线网络，从东亚一直延伸到地中海地区，覆盖了广阔的地 区和令人惊叹的各种景观。“长安一天山廊道”是“丝绸之路”网络的重要组成部分，贯穿中 国、哈萨克斯坦、吉尔吉斯坦三国，全长约5, 000公里，贸易路线总长8700公里。这三个国 家共同向联合国教科文组织申请世界遗产。他们提交的提案中包含了走廊沿线33个地点的详 细研究。“长安一天山廊道”以独特的方式创造了历史，成为第一个成功通过的跨国世界遗产 申请一一这似乎只是“丝绸之路”申遗的开始，因为其他国家也都在计划为“丝绸之路”网路 的其他部分申请世界遗产。  

The starting point of the corridor and the entire Silk Road network is Chang* an (present-day Xi' an), in Shaanxi Province of north-west China. It was famous as the capital of the Han and Tang Dynasties. Further west on the Silk Road, the geography gradually changes from wild deserts to high, snow-capped mountains to vast grasslands as the routes pass through the splendid Tianshan Mountains and emerge in the rolling valleys of Central Asia. Although the Chang* an-Tianshan Corridor ends here, the network continues westwards until it reaches the Mediterranean.  
这条廊道和整个“丝绸之路”网络的起点都是长安(今西安)，位于中国西北部的陕西省， 是著名的汉唐都城。继续向西，“丝绸之路”穿过壮丽的天山山脉，出现在中亚起伏的山谷中， 一•路地貌各不相同，从荒凉的沙漠到高耸的雪山，再到广阔的草原。虽然“长安一天山廊道” 到此结束，但“丝绸之路”网络继续向西，直到地中海。  

The Silk Road began to develop in the 2nd century BCE. Assigned by the emperor; the ambassador Zhang Qian journeyed from Chang' an to Central Asia, seeking to build bridges between the Han Dynasty and the Western Regions. Following Zhang* s efforts, trade routes took shape and relationships were strengthened between the major powers of the time, with the routes network reaching as far as the Roman Empire. The network expanded gradually, playing an important role in world history between the 6th and 14th centuries, and remained in use until the 16th century.  
“丝绸之路”从公元前2世纪开始发展。使臣张骞受皇帝之命从长安出使中亚，试图架起 汉朝和西域之冋的桥梁。随着张骞的不懈努力，贸易网络逐渐形成，各国间的关系也更加稳固。 那时各大国之冋的航线网络一度远达罗马帝国。网络逐渐扩大，在6世纪至14世纪期间在世 界历史上发挥了重要作用，并一直使用到16世纪。  

At the initial stage of the Silk Road development, silk was the main item in the trade list thanks to its light weight and high value. At its peak, many other items were contributed to the marketplace of goods. The routes were alive with strings of camels carrying loads of goods and traders selling everything imaginable. China' s exports included silk, china and tea, while horses, wool, cotton and grapes were all imported over vast distances along the network.  
“丝绸之路”发展初期，丝绸因其重量轻、价值高而成为贸易清单上的主要商品。鼎盛时 期，许多其他物品也在商品市场交易。这些路上有一队队驮着货物的骆驼和在兜售你能想到的 任何商品的商人，因此充满了活力。中国出口的货物包括丝绸、瓷器和茶叶，而马、羊毛、棉 花和葡萄都是沿着这个网横跨遥远的距离进口的。  

In addition to trade exchange, the network served as a bridge for cultural exchange which shaped the evolution of science, art, technology and many other areas in societies along the network. Astronomy and mathematics were introduced to China from India and Arabia; in Gansu Province, the Mogao Caves, home to some of the finest examples of Buddhist art, reflected the eastward spread of Buddhism from India; important Chinese inventions such as papermaking and printing were first brought to the West through the network.  
除了贸易，“丝绸之路”网络还充当了文化交流的桥梁，促进沿线各地的科学、艺术、技 术以及其他领域的发展。天文学和数学从印度和阿拉伯半岛传入中国;甘肃省的莫高窟保存着 许多佛教艺术最优秀的作品，反映了佛教从印度向东传播的历史；中国重要的发明，如造纸术 和印刷术，首先是通过“丝绸之路”网络传入西方的。 All of these activities contributed to a great age of expansion as trade and cultural exchanges gave people access to new goods, knowledge and ideas. These amazingly long routes connected Eastern and Western civilizations, which achieved a shared development. In the modern age, through the Belt and Road Initiative, the Silk Road is once again connecting the countries along the ancient trade routes and promoting the exchanges of different civilizations. The addition of the Chang, an-Tianshan Corridor to the UNESCO World Heritage List is a milestone in recognition of the Silk Road as a crucial part of humanity' s common heritage.  
贸易和文化交流让人们获得了新的商品、知识和思想，所有这些活动都促成了一个伟大的 扩张时代。这些令人惊奇的迢迢道路连接着东西方文明，实现了（东西方的）共同发展。当今时 代，通过“一带一路”倡议，“丝綢之路”再次将古代贸易路线沿线国家连接起来，促进不同 文明间的交流。“长安一天山廊道”被列入联合国教科文组织世界遗产名录是承认“丝绸之路” 是人类共同遗产重要组成部分的里程碑。

**After Twenty Years**  
**《二十年后》**  

The policeman on the beat walked along the streel as he always did. It was barely ten o'clock at night. When he had walked about halfway around a certain block, the policeman suddenly slowed down. In the doorway of a store stood a man, with an unlit cigar in his mouth.  
巡逻的警察像往常一样沿着街道走着。当时还不到晚上十点钟。当他走了大约半个街区的时候，警察突然放慢了速度。在一家商店的门口站着一个男人，嘴里叼着一支未点燃的雪茄。  

“It’s all right, officer,” he said. “I’m just waiting for a friend. It’s an appointment made two decades ago. There used to be a restaurant where this store stands — ‘Big Joe’ Brady’s restaurant.”  
“没事的，警官，”他说。“我只是在等一个朋友。这是20年前的约定。这家店所在的地方曾经有一家餐馆——‘Big Joe’Brady's餐厅。”  

“It was here until five years ago,” said the policeman. “It was torn down then.”  
“五年前它一直在这里，”警察说。“之后它被拆除了。”  

The man in the doorway struck a match and lit his cigar. The light showed a pale face, with keen eyes, a square jaw and a little white scar near his right eyebrow. His scarfpin was a large diamond, oddly set.  
站在门口的人划了根火柴，点燃了雪茄。光线照出一张苍白的脸，眼神锐利，方下巴，右眉毛附近有一道小小的白色伤疤。他的领巾别针是一颗大钻石，嵌得很奇怪。  

“Twenty years ago tonight,” said the man, “I dined here with Jimmy Wells, my best friend. He and I were just like two brothers. I was eighteen and Jimmy was twenty. The next morning I left New York and traveled to the West to make my fortune. Well, we agreed that night that we would meet here again exactly twenty years later, no matter what our conditions might be or what distance we might have to come from. We figured that in twenty years each of us would have built a life and made our fortunes.  
“20年前的今晚，”那人说，“我和我最好的朋友吉米·威尔斯在这里吃饭。他和我就像兄弟一样。我18岁，吉米20岁。 第二天早上，我离开纽约，到西部去发财。那天晚上，我们约定，20年后，无论我们的条件如何，无论我们相距多远，我们都会在这里再次见面。我们认为，在20年的时间里，我们每个人都会有自己的生活和财富。  

“It sounds pretty remarkable,” said the policeman. “Rather a long time between meetings, though.”  
“听起来很有意思，”警察说。“不过会面间隔时间太长了。”  

“Oh, I know Jimmy will meet me here if he’s alive, for he always was the truest and most reliable fellow in the world. He’ll never forget. We lost contact but I came a thousand miles to stand in this doorway tonight, and it’s worthwhile if my old partner turns up.”  
“哦，我知道基米如果还活着，他会来这儿和我见面的，因为他一直是世界上最诚实、最可靠的人。他永远不会忘记。我们失去了联系，但我千里迢迢来到这里，今晚站在这个门口，如果我的老朋友出现，这也是值得的。”  

The waiting man pulled out a handsome watch, set with small diamonds. It was three minutes to ten.  
等候的人掏出一块镶有小钻石的漂亮手表。现在是十点差三分。  

“I’ll be on my way,” said the policeman. “Hope your friend turns up.”  
“我马上就走，”警察说。“希望你的朋友出现。”  

“Bye, officer.”  
“再见,长官。”  

The man who had come a thousand miles to keep an appointment with the friend of his youth smoked his cigar and waited. About twenty minutes later, a tall man in a long overcoat, with collar turned up to his ears, hurried towards him.  
那位千里迢迢赶来赴约的青年朋友抽着雪茄，等待着。大约过了二十分钟，一个穿着长大衣的高个子男人匆匆向他走来，衣领翻到耳朵上。  

“Is that you, Bob?” he asked, doubtfully.  
“是你吗，鲍勃?”他不确定地问道。  

“Is that you, Jimmy Wels?” shouted the man in the doorway.  
“是你吗，吉米·威尔斯?” 门口的那个人回道。  

“Bless my heart!” cried the new arrival. “Well, well, well! Twenty years is a long time! How has the West treated you, old man?”  
“天呐!这位刚到这儿的人叫道。“好家伙! 二十年真长啊! 老伙计，在西部过得咋样啊?”  

“It has given me everything I asked it for. You’ve changed lots, Jimmy. You seem taller, at least two or three inches.”  
“它给了我想要的一切。你变了很多，吉米。你看起来高了，至少有两三英寸了。”  

“Oh, I grew a bit after I was twenty. Come on, Bob; we’ll go to a place I know and have a good long talk about old times.”  
“哦，我二十岁以后还长了一些。来，鲍勃；我们找个地方好好聊聊。”  

The two men walked up the street, arm in arm. The man from the West was beginning to outline the history of his career. At the corner stood a drugstore, brilliant with electric lights. Each of them turned to examine the other’s face. The man from the West stopped suddenly and released his arm.  
那两个人手挽着手沿街走着。那个从西部来的人开始概述他的职业生涯。街角有一家药店，灯火辉煌。两人都转过身来仔细打量着对方的脸。那个从西部来的人突然停了下来，松开了手臂。  

“As I suspected, you’re not Jimmy Wells,” he said, impatiently with anger. “Twenty years is a long time, but not long enough to change the shape of a man’s nose.”  
“正如我所怀疑的那样，你不是吉米·威尔斯，”他怒道。“二十年很长，但不足以改变一个人的鼻子形状。”  

“It sometimes changes a good man into a bad one,” said the tall man, taking charge of the situation. ＂You’ve been under arrest for ten minutes, ‘Silky’ Bob. Chicago police thought you might have dropped over our way and wired us. They want to have a chat with you. Before we go to the station, here’s a note for you. It’s from Patrolman Wells.”  
“但它有时会把一个好人变成一个坏人，”高个子男人回道。“你已经被捕十分钟了，滑头鲍勃。芝加哥警方认为你可能顺道来过，给我们发了电报。他们想和你谈谈。在我们去警局之前，有张纸条给你。是巡警威尔斯发来的。”  

The man from the West unfolded the paper. The note was rather short.  
那个从西部来的人打开了那张纸。 这封信写得很短：  

“Bob: I was at the appointed place on time. When you struck the match to light your cigar I saw it was the face of the criminal wanted in Chicago. Anyhow I couldn’t arrest you myself, so l got a plain-clothes man to do the job. JIMМY.”  
(Adapted from O. Henry’s short story of the same title)  
鲍勃:我准时到了约定的地点。当你划火柴点燃雪茄时，我看到那正是芝加哥通缉的罪犯的脸。无论如何我不能亲自逮捕你，所以我找了个便衣来处理这件事。——吉米”

**Taking responsibility**  
**《担起责任》**  

Honoured guests, friends, teachers and students, it is my pleasure and privilege to welcome you here today and present my thoughts on this very special occasion.  
尊敬的来宾、朋友、老师和同学们，我很高兴和荣幸今天在这里欢迎你们，并在这个非常特殊的时刻和你们谈谈我的想法。  

Students, the time has arrived for you to fully accept your passage into adulthood. I have seen you grow from nervous Senior 1 students into the confident young adults who sit before me today, ready to embrace the next phase of your lives. I am sure that you are both excited and anxious about the new experiences that are in store for you. However, you need not worry, for I know that you are all responsible young people, well prepared and well equipped to successfully manage the challenges of the years ahead.  
同学们，你们完全接受自己进入成年的时刻已经到来了。我看到你们从紧张的高一学生成长为今天坐在我面前的自信的年轻人，准备迎接你们生活的下一个阶段。我相信你们对即将到来的新经历既兴奋又焦虑。不过，你们不必担心，因为我知道你们都是负责任的年轻人，准备充分，准备充分，能够成功地应付今后几年的挑战。  

During your time at school, you have grown to understand the importance of a well-developed sense of responsibility. You accept that you are responsible for your successes and your failures. Hopefully, you have learnt to treat responsibility, not as a weight that burdens you, but rather as a foundation which will support your future development. A ship without an anchor is at the mercy of the waves and the winds; likewise, a person who has no sense of responsibility is at the mercy of their own careless and thoughtless behaviours.  
在你们上学的这段时间里，你们已经明白了发展良好的责任感的重要性。你承认你要为自己的成功和失败负责。希望你们已经学会了对待责任，而不是把它当作负担你们的包袱，而是支持你们未来发展的基础。没有锚的船，任凭风浪摆布；同样，一个没有责任感的人也会受自己粗心大意行为的支配。  

As students, you must take your studies seriously and accept responsibility for your own learning. Taking responsibility means meeting deadlines for your school work, following your teachers’ guidance and, of course, always aiming for academic excellence. However, your responsibilities go far beyond your studies. As you go through your daily life, you will encounter many difficult situations where things will go wrong. Instead of being quick to blame others, analyse the problem and, if it is indeed your own fault, be ready to admit your mistake and then correct it. This way, you practise the virtue of courage. AIways give your best in whatever you set out to do, however difficult that might be. This way, you practise the virtue of determination. Be honest by saying what you mean and by meaning what you say. This way, you practise the virtue of integrity. Taking responsibility in all aspects of your everyday life, therefore, will help build a strong character.  
作为学生，你必须认真对待你的学习，接受自己的承担的学习责任。承担责任意味着要在最后期限前完成学业，听从老师的指导，当然，还要始终追求卓越。然而，你的责任远远超出了你的学业。在你的日常生活中，你会遇到很多事情会出错的困难情况。不要急于指责别人，分析问题，如果确实是你自己的错，要准备好承认错误，然后改正它。这样，你就锻炼了勇气的美德。无论你着手去做什么，无论有多难，都要全力以赴。这样，你就练习了决心的美德。诚实地说出你的意思和你所说的意思。这样，你就锻炼了正直的美德。因此，在日常生活的各个方面承担责任，将有助于塑造一个坚强的性格。  

Apart from personal development, assuming responsibility for your actions is also important for the betterment of society. Society is an organic whole and, as social beings, we have a responsibility to help make it better. You may have heard the story of the small boy who tried to save starfish left on the beach after a storm, by throwing them back into the ocean, Passers-by told him that he was wasting his time, for he could not possibly save them all. However, the boy was not discouraged, believing that he could make a difference to the ones that he saved. As a result, the passers-by felt inspired and joined him that in saving the starfish. Similarly, the little things you do can make a difference! For example, picking up garbage around your neighbourhood contributes to a cleaner environment. Reporting a speeding car helps ensure road safety. Being energy-efficient leads lo savings of our precious natural resources. Doing volunteer work at a local nursing home brings love and warmth to the elderly. Just like the “starfish boy”, you may even inspire people around you to do the same, which might be considered an added bonus. Working together, we have the power to gradually but continuously change our society for the better.  
除了个人发展，为自己的行为承担责任对社会的改善也很重要。社会是一个有机的整体，作为社会人，我们有责任帮助改善它。你可能听过一个小男孩的故事，他在暴风雨后试图把落在海滩上的海星扔回大海。路人告诉他，他是在浪费时间，因为他不可能把它们都救回来。然而，这个男孩并没有气馁，他相信他可以让那些被他拯救的人有所改变。结果，路过的人都受到启发，和他一起去救海星。同样，你做的小事情也能带来不同！例如，捡起周围的垃圾有助于清洁环境。报告超速车辆有助于确保道路安全。节能意味着节约我们宝贵的自然资源。 在当地的养老院做志愿者可以给老人带来爱和温暖。就像“海星男孩”一样，你们甚至可以激励身边的人也同样去做，这也是种额外的收获。通过共同努力，我们有能力逐步而持续地改变社会，使之变得更好。  

So, dear students, take your first step into the adult world by accepting your responsibilities, so that adulthood will be an enjoyable and rewarding experience for both you and those around you. Sometimes, responsibilities may weigh heavily on you. However, just as the Chinese saying goes, “Jade is good for nothing if not carved.”  
所以，亲爱的同学们，请接受你们的责任，踏出你们迈入成人世界的第一步，这样，成年对你们和你们周围的人来说都将是一段愉快而有益的经历。有时，责任可能会沉重地压在你们身上。 然而，正如中国谚语所说，“玉不琢不成器”。  

A man cannot be perfected without trials. Sow the seeds of success today and your harvest will be great tomorrow. I wish you every success in your adult life!  
一个人不经过考验就不能臻于完美。今天播下成功的种子，明天就会有更大的收获。祝你们成年后事事顺利!

**Effective communication**  
**《有效沟通》**  

If you heard someone shout, “Hey you!” from across the room, how would you react? Just these two words can carry much information. They could be interpreted as a welcoming greeting from a close friend, especially if accompanied by a gentle smile. When spoken by a stranger, they can function as a means of attracting your attention. Much of what we communicate is dependent not only on the words we use, but also on how we use them. So, let’s look a little deeper into the topic of communication.  
如果你听到有人喊:“嘿，你! ，你会有什么反应? 仅仅这两个词就能传达很多信息。 这句话可以被理解为来自亲密朋友的欢迎问候，尤其是伴随着温柔的微笑。 当陌生人和你说话时，它们可以作为一种吸引你注意力的方式。我们交流的内容不仅取决于我们使用的词语，还取决于我们如何使用它们。 所以，让我们更深入地了解一下沟通这个话题。  

Communication is the exchange of information between a sender and a receiver. The sender encodes a message and sends it face to face, or through video, telephone, mail or social media. This message is then received and decoded by the receiver. In response, the receiver sends an encoded message back, which is referred to as feedback. This feedback is decoded by the original sender and the entire cycle repeats itself until they have finished communicating.  
沟通是发送者和接收者之间的信息交换。 发送者对信息进行编码，然后面对面发送，或者通过视频、电话、邮件或社交媒体。 然后这个信息被接收方接收并解码。 作为响应，接收方发送一个编码后的消息，这被称为反馈。 这个反馈被最初的发送者解码，整个循环不断重复，直到他们完成交流。  

This complex process can be challenging but, with practice and patience, you can become a highly competent communicator. To accomplish this, you need to know with whom you are communicating. What is their age or job position? What is their relationship to you? What expectations and cultural background do they have? Once you have obtained this information, you can then use it to determine how best to communicate with them. Depending on if you are communicating with a stranger, friend, family member, or co-worker, you will need to decide which communication channel best suits the situation. Furthermore, you will need to determine the appropriate style to use and how complex your choice of words should be. For example, if you are a business person negotiating with a large enterprise about a deal, you should do it face to face, using formal language, in a straightforward manner.  
这个复杂的过程可能是有挑战性的，但是，通过练习和耐心，你可以成为一个非常有能力的沟通者。 要做到这一点，你需要知道你在和谁交流。 他们的年龄或职位是什么? 他们和你是什么关系? 他们有什么样的期望和文化背景? 一旦你获得了这些信息，你就可以用它来决定如何与他们沟通。这取决于你在与陌生人、朋友、家人或同事交流时，需要决定哪种交流渠道最适合这种情况。此外，您还需要确定要使用的适当的风格以及您选择词汇的复杂程度。 例如，如果你是一个商务人士，正在与一家大企业谈判一笔交易，你应该面对面，使用正式语言，以一种直截了当的方式进行谈判。  

Your body language is equally important, since it reveals a lot about your thoughts and attitudes. Make sure it clearly supports the message you want to deliver. A smile shows you are attentive to the issues you are discussing, while looking away with your arms folded can indicate disinterest and create distrust or cause friction. Additionally, you should not ignore the other person’s body language, which will give you clues as to whether the conversation is going well or not. When you notice a change in the other person’s body language, you should adjust how you are communicating accordingly. If someone looks at you with a confused expression, this could indicate that they have not completely understood your point. You will need to clarify your message before moving on.  
你的肢体语言同样重要，因为它透露了很多你的想法和态度。 确保它清楚地支持您想要传递的消息。 微笑表明你对正在讨论的问题很关注，而双臂交叉望向别处则表示不感兴趣、产生不信任或引起摩擦。 此外，你不应该忽视对方的肢体语言，它会给你一些线索，让你知道谈话是否进行得顺利。 当你注意到对方的肢体语言有变化时，你应该相应地调整你的沟通方式。 如果有人带着困惑的表情看着你，这可能表明他们没有完全理解你的观点。 在继续之前，你需要阐明你的信息。  

While being knowledgeable about body language is vital, the value of empathy should not be understated. Seek to understand the other person’s emotions, by putting yourself in their shoes and looking at the situation from their perspective. Some issues may be complicated and you may be confused about why others feel or act the way they do. If you give serious consideration to their points of view, however, you will be able to see what accounts for their emotions and empathize with them. You may not approve of their ideas but at least you will see where they are coming from, which means you can make adjustments to your own tone and choice of words. Suppose you are discussing a project with your partner, who has just lost an important basketball game and is inactive. To engage him or her in the discussion and make your communication more effective, you may express your sympathy by, for instance, saying, “I understand how you feel.…”  
虽然了解肢体语言至关重要，但同理心的价值也不应被低估。 试着理解对方的情绪，设身处地地从他们的角度来看问题。 有些问题可能很复杂，你可能会困惑为什么其他人会有这样的感觉或行为。 然而，如果你认真考虑他们的观点，你就能看到是什么导致了他们的情绪，并与他们产生共鸣。 你可能不赞成他们的想法，但至少你会看到他们的想法，这意味着你可以调整自己的语气和用词。 假设你正在和你的伙伴讨论一个项目，他刚刚输了一场重要的篮球比赛，很不活跃。 为了让他或她参与讨论，使你的沟通更有效，你可以表达你的同情，例如，说:“我理解你的感受....”。  

Effective communication will allow you to tackle differences and disagreements appropriately and improve your interactions with others. Good communication skills will also help you build trust and gain other peoples respect, allowing relationships to become more positive and productive. So, get practising and good luck!  
有效的沟通将使你能够适当地处理分歧和分歧，并改善你与他人的互动。 良好的沟通技巧也能帮助你建立信任，赢得他人的尊重，让人际关系变得更加积极和富有成效。所以，努力尝试吧，祝你好运!

**Borrowed words**  
**《外来词》**  

“The sushi restaurant’s menu was confusing.” Is there anything special about this sentence? Well, all the words except “the” and "was” are borrowed from other languages! This comes as nо surprise, given that English has borrowed words from more than 300 different languages, including Latin, Greek, French and Chinese. However, English is not alone in borrowing words from other languages — borrowed words can be found in almost all languages. For example, Chinese words that are originally from the English language include “培根” (bacon), “坦克” (tank) and “高尔夫” (golf), and Japanese has borrowed words like “豆腐” (tofu) from Chinese.  
“The sushi restaurant’s menu was confusing.” “寿司店的菜单太混乱了。” 这句话有什么特别之处吗? 嗯，除了“the”和“was”之外，所有的单词都是从其他语言拿来的! 已知英语从300多种不同的语言(包括拉丁语、希腊语、法语和汉语)中借用了词汇，这让人很惊讶。 然而，英语并不是唯一从其他语言中借用词汇的语言——几乎所有的语言都有借用词汇。 例如,中国是来自英语的词语,包括“培根”(bacon),”坦克”(tank)和“高尔夫”(golf)和日本借了这样的词“豆腐”(tofu)来自中国。  

Word borrowing comes about when two cultures with different languages interact. This tends to happen when there is no suitable word for an object or idea in the native tongue. This phenomenon has been occurring for thousands of years. In the current age of globalization, when communication technology brings different cultures closer together, words are even more likely to be borrowed straight from the source language at a faster pace than ever before, especially those related to technological developments, such as “email” and “Internet”.  
当两种不同语言的文化相互作用时，就产生了外来词。 当母语中没有合适的词来表达一个物体或想法时，这种情况就会发生。 这种现象已经发生了几千年。 在当今的全球化时代，通信技术使不同的文化更加紧密地联系在一起，词汇更有可能以比以往更快的速度直接从源语言中借用，特别是那些与技术发展有关的词汇，如“email”和“Internet”。  

Though borrowing words has become faster, the process is still complex, and it takes time before new words are integrated into everyday speech. At first, the borrowed word is only used by bilingual speakers. It then spreads to people who do not know the original language, and they will change the pronunciation to fit the way they speak, almost unknowingly. An example of this is the word “kung fu”, which refers to Chinese martial arts. This word comes from the Chinese words “功夫” (gongfu). Over time, the sounds that were difficult to pronounce were replaced with more familiar ones. The longer a borrowed word has been in use, the more it sounds and even looks like the native language.  
虽然借用单词的速度变快了，但过程仍然很复杂，而且要将新单词融入日常用语需要时间。 起初，外来词只有双语使用者才会使用。 然后传播给不懂母语的人，他们会在几乎不知情的情况下改变发音，以适应自己的说话方式。 一个例子就是“功夫”这个词，它指的是中国武术。 这个词来自于汉字“功夫”(武术)。 随着时间的推移，那些难以发音的声音被更熟悉的声音所取代。 外来词用的越久，它听起来甚至看起来就越像本国的词。  

Borrowed words are an outcome of language development that could hardly be avoided, but some language communities oppose adopting words from other cultures. There are countries that make interventions to keep their native language pure in order to defend their identity. The French specifically have an official organization that creates new words, in order to avoid borrowed words. Some languages have an extremely small number of speakers, such as the Native American Navajo Indian language, used only by the members of the tribe. Under this circumstance, it becomes a matter of survival for the native language to reject outside influences.  
外来词是语言发展的必然结果，这是不可避免的，但一些语言团体反对从其他文化中吸收外来词。 有些国家为了保护自己的身份，会进行干预，以保持本国语言的纯正性。 为了避免外来词，法国有专门的官方组织来创造新词。 有些语言只有极少数人使用，例如印第安土著纳瓦霍语，只有部落成员使用。 在这种情况下，拒绝外来影响就成了母语的生存问题。  

While some communities are pessimistic about the exchange between languages, there are also other languages that readily welcome borrowed words. English, especially, is based on a mix of Latin, Greek and Germanic languages. The English-speaking community does not hesitate in absorbing foreign words into its daily vocabulary. In fact, there have never been any formal academic restrictions on new borrowed words. Borrowing words allows the language to continue to develop, enabling the community to have a more efficient language which allows them to share their experiences with a new-found grace. It is also through those words that novel ideas are spread and different beliefs are exchanged more conveniently and quickly.  
虽然一些社区对语言之间的交流持悲观态度，但也有其他语言欢迎外来词汇。 尤其是英语，它是由拉丁语、希腊语和日耳曼语混合而成的。 说英语的群体会毫不犹豫地把外国词汇吸收到日常词汇中。 事实上，从来没有任何正式的学术限制新的借用词。 借用词汇可以使语言继续发展，使社区拥有一种更有效的语言，使他们能够以一种新的优雅来分享他们的经验。 也正是通过这些词语，新奇的思想得以传播，不同的信仰得以更方便快捷地交换。  

According to the linguist Edward Sapir, “It would be difficult to point to a completely isolated language,” and for better or for worse, the tendency to borrow words has never gone out of style. The more international and globalized the world becomes, the more language characteristics will be shared between nations and cultures.  
根据语言学家爱德华·萨皮尔(Edward Sapir)的说法，“很难指出一种完全孤立的语言”，无论好坏，借用词汇的趋势从未过时。 世界越国际化、全球化，不同民族、不同文化之间的语言特征就越多。

**Work to live, live to work**  
**《工作是为了生活，生活是为了工作》**  

If you were asked the question, “Do you work to live or live to work?”, what would your answer be? Some might say that we work because we have to, not least because we need the salary that enables us to be financially independent. It is certainly true that most of us do join the labour force once our studies are completed. Indeed, it could be argued that our education is geared towards preparing us for a life of work. However, earning a living is, by no means, the only reason why we work — there are other important reasons that motivate our entry into the world of work.  
如果有人问你:“你工作是为了生活还是生活是为了工作?” ，你的答案是什么? 有些人可能会说，我们工作是因为我们必须这样做，尤其是因为我们需要能让我们在经济上独立的薪水。 的确，我们大多数人在学习结束后就加入了劳动大军。 事实上，可以说，我们的教育是为了让我们为一生的工作做好准备。 然而，谋生绝不是我们工作的唯一原因——还有其他重要的原因促使我们进入工作的世界。  

Through the work we do, our goals can be attained and our personal dreams achieved. All of us have had dreams about one thing or another and work often enables us to pursue those dreams. Henry David Thoreau said, “… if one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.” Yang Liwei, for example, driven by his passion for flying, became a pilot and then China’s first astronaut. Wherever our interests may lie and whatever our career choices might be, work allows us the opportunity to be engaged in something we are fond of and, consequently, can give us a sense of achievement and great satisfaction.  
通过我们所做的工作，我们的目标可以实现，我们的个人梦想也可以实现。 我们所有人都有这样或那样的梦想，而工作常常能让我们追求这些梦想。 亨利·大卫·梭罗说过:“……如果一个人自信地朝着梦想的方向前进，努力地过他想象中的生活，他就会在平常的时候获得意想不到的成功。” 例如，杨利伟，由于他对飞行的热情，成为了一名飞行员，然后成为了中国的第一个宇航员。 无论我们的兴趣是什么，无论我们的职业选择是什么，工作让我们有机会从事我们喜欢的事情，因此，可以给我们一种成就感和极大的满足感。  

Work can also help develop our skills, thus providing room for personal growth. When we work, we must practise our skills constantly and continuously until we excel in what we do. Our rapidly changing workplace makes it necessary for us to keep up and develop new skills. Twenty years ago, positions in social technologies or energy efficiency did not even exist, and it is difficult to anticipate the new positions which will emerge twenty years from now. However, it is certain that no which one can afford to be satisfied with the status quo. In order to better adapt ourselves to new circumstances, we must be ready and willing to acquire new skills and abilities. This can add to our sense of achievement and the knowledge that we are developing as individuals as we move along our chosen career path.  
工作还可以帮助我们发展技能，从而为个人成长提供空间。当我们工作时，我们必须不断地练习我们的技能，直到我们在我们所做的事情上出类拔萃。我们快速变化的工作场所使我们有必要跟上和发展新的技能。20年前，社会技术或能源效率方面的职位甚至还不存在，很难预测20年后会出现什么样的新职位。然而，可以肯定的是，没有一个人能够满足于现状。为了使自己更好地适应新的环境，我们必须准备并愿意学习新的技能和能力。 这可以增加我们的成就感，并让我们知道，在我们选择的职业道路上，我们个人正在发展。  

Not only does work benefit us personally, it also contributes to the health of society. At the most basic level, the different types of jobs are like gears in a machine. They work to ensure that the machine we call “society” functions properly. In a successful, stable and productive society, all jobs are equally important and no one is superior to another, so we should not have prejudice against any. Whether we are scientists, lawyers, doctors, public servants, consultants, clerks receptionists or butchers, we all make our respective contributions. Moreover, there are people who choose to step out of their comfort zone and commit themselves to working for the benefit of others. For example, teachers in remote rural areas are devoted to changing the lives of people with less access to the advantages enjoyed by many others. In this way, we work to advance our communities and bring success to our nation.  
工作不仅有利于我们个人，它也有助于社会的健康。在最基本的层面上，不同类型的工作就像机器上的齿轮。他们的工作是确保我们称之为“社会”的机器正常运转。在一个成功、稳定和有生产力的社会里，所有的工作都是同等重要的，没有人比别人优越，所以我们不应该对任何工作有偏见。无论我们是科学家、律师、医生、公务员、顾问、书记员、接待员还是屠夫，我们都做出了自己的贡献。此外，有些人选择走出自己的舒适区，致力于为他人的利益而工作。例如，偏远农村地区的教师致力于改变人们的生活，他们很少有机会享受其他许多人所享有的优势。通过这种方式，我们努力推动我们的社区发展，为我们的国家带来成功。  

Wherever life takes us and whatever choices are laid out before us, something worth remembering is that our work, when done well, will not only help us make a living but also help make a life for ourselves and for others. We can take pride in the knowledge that hard work is essential for our individual well-being as well as for the benefit of our society as a whole.  
无论生活将我们带到哪里，无论摆在我们面前的是什么选择，值得记住的是，我们的工作，如果做得好，不仅会帮助我们谋生，还会帮助我们自己和他人创造生活。 我们可以自豪地认识到，努力工作对于我们个人的福祉以及整个社会的利益都是必不可少的。

**Tips for job interviews**  
**《面试的技巧》**  

Good morning, everyone. Today I’ll be talking about what to do if you’re asked to go for a job interview. The odds are that you’ve never been a candidate for a job before, but my advice will help you gain the upper hand as you set off and step into the world of employment.  
大家早上好。今天我要谈论的是，如果你被要求去参加工作面试，应该怎么做。很有可能你以前从来没有做过一份工作的候选人，但我的建议会帮助你在开始并步入职场时占上风。  

Before we go any further, it’s important to understand the purpose of an interview. An interview is a conversation between an employer and a potential employee, which allows the interviewer to assess the job applicant to see if he or she is suitable for the position. Meanwhile, it also provides an opportunity for the applicant to learn more about the job and the company, and to discover whether this job is right for him or her.  
在我们继续之前，了解面试的目的是很重要的。 面试是雇主和潜在雇员之间的对话，面试官可以评估应聘者是否适合这个职位。 同时，它也为求职者提供了一个了解工作和公司的机会，并发现这个工作是否适合他或她。  

Prior to the interview, ensure you make good preparations. Find out about the company and the role you are interviewing for through the company’s profile and website. This information will give you a good basis of what criteria they use to select candidates. List your strengths and skill set that will help the company achieve their goals. It’s equally important to analyse your weaknesses and have a plan in mind to show how you intend to strengthen them.  
面试前，一定要做好充分的准备。 通过该公司的简介和网站了解该公司和你正在应聘的职位。 这些信息将为你提供一个很好的基础，让你知道他们选择候选人的标准。 列出你能帮助公司实现目标的强项和技能。 同样重要的是，分析你的弱点，并在头脑中制定计划，表明你打算如何加强它们。  

Once you’ve done your homework about the company and the position, make a list of questions that could be asked during the interview and think about how to best answer them. Better yet, do practice interviews with a friend. You can film the interviews to review your performance. Pay attention to your voice and body language. Practice makes perfect. Keep at it until you can concisely and confidently present your best self.  
一旦你对公司和职位做了充分的了解，就把在面试过程中可能被问到的问题列出来，然后思考如何最好地回答这些问题。 更好的方法是和朋友一起练习面试。 你可以把面试过程录下来，回顾一下自己的表现。 注意你的声音和肢体语言。 熟能生巧。 坚持下去，直到你能够简洁、自信地展示你最好的自己。  

Prepare to make a good first impression. Dress appropriately for your interview and gentlemen, be sure to have a good shave. Get a good night’s rest so that you feel and look refreshed. Check the address of the interview, decide what mode of transport to use and allow extra time for traffic delays. Remember, be an early bird and arrive at least half an hour before your confirmed interview time.  
准备好留下良好的第一印象。面试时穿着得体，先生们，一定要刮胡子。晚上好好休息，这样你会感觉精神焕发。检查面试地点，决定使用何种交通方式，为交通延误留出额外的时间。记住，要做一个早起的人，至少在确定面试时间前半小时到达。  

For the duration of the interview, listen carefully to the question, and if you need clarification, it is not rude to say so. When answering, try to find the right conversational balance by giving all the information an interviewer needs to get a complete picture of you without talking too much. Justify yourself with relevant examples from your personal experience and be specific about your achievements. However, you’ll also need to pay attention to the interviewer’s responses to determine whether to provide more details or not.  
在面试的过程中，仔细听问题，如果你需要澄清，那么说出来并不是不礼貌的。 在回答问题的时候，试着在对话中找到恰当的平衡，把所有面试官需要的信息都告诉他，让他不费太多口舌就能对你有一个全面的了解。用你个人经历中的相关例子来证明你自己，并具体说明你的成就。然而，你也需要注意面试官的回答，以决定是否提供更多的细节。  

The interviewer can infer a lot from your body language. Positive body language conveys the impression that you are confident and relaxed. So start with a firm handshake and a genuine smile when greeting the interviewer. While speaking, make constant eye contact but do not stare fixedly at the interviewer. Keep your back straight throughout the interview. Negative body language such as yawning, looking around and crossing your arms, is to be avoided because it implies that you are bored, anxious or defensive.  
面试官可以从你的肢体语言中推断出很多信息。积极的肢体语言给人一种自信和放松的印象。所以当你和面试官打招呼的时候，首先要握手坚定，并报以真诚的微笑。说话的时候，要保持眼神交流，但不要盯着面试官看。在整个面试过程中保持背部挺直。 要避免消极的肢体语言，比如打哈欠、环顾四周、交叉双臂，因为这暗示着你感到无聊、焦虑或有戒心。  

Towards the end of the interview, don’t forget to seize the moment and ask questions. An interview is a two-way street. Ask questions that give you a better picture of the company while allowing you to address any strengths you weren’t able to bring up naturally. For example, “Japanese was a minor subject I took and I know that expanding into Japan is part of your corporate plan. Will this position provide opportunities to work in emerging markets there?”  
面试快结束的时候，不要忘记抓住机会提问。面试是双向的。问一些能让你对公司有一个更好的了解的问题，同时也能让你说出你不能很自然地提到的优点。例如，“日语是我辅修的课程，我知道向日本扩张是你们公司计划的一部分。这个职位能否提供在新兴市场工作的机会?”  

After the interview, you should follow up by writing to thank the interviewer for giving you the opportunity and again express your interest in working for the company. This is not only a polite thing to do, but also a final chance to recommend yourself. It’s also vital to look back on the process to see what you did well and where improvements are still needed.  
面试结束后，你应该写信感谢面试官给你这个机会，并再次表达你为这家公司工作的兴趣。这不仅是一件礼貌的事情，也是最后一次自我推荐的机会。回顾这个过程，看看你在哪些方面做得不错，哪些地方还需要改进，这也是非常重要的。  

If you follow these steps and put your best foot forward in your interview, you will be one step closer to reaching the end of the rainbow and obtaining your dream job. I wish you the best of luck!  
如果你按照下面的步骤去做，在面试中展现出最好的一面，你就会离彩虹的尽头和获得梦想工作又近了一步。祝你好运!

**Learning for life**  
**《终身学习》**  

The more I learn, the better I know how much there is still left to learn. As I journey through my life, I have become aware that acquiring knowledge is not only a means by which you can better understand the world, but also a way of appreciating how much, as an individual, you do not know. The ability to admit this should be perceived not as a weakness, but as a strength. I once had an art teacher who pointed out that it is not only what you can see that is important, but also what you cannot see. When I drew a still life, it was impressed upon me that the blank spaces between the objects were just as vital to the success of the composition as the actual objects themselves. Also, as the great educator Confucius stated, “When you know a thing, to recognize that you know it and when you do not know a thing, to recognize that you do not know it — that is knowledge!”  
我学得越多，就越知道还有多少东西要学。 在我的人生旅途中，我已经意识到，获取知识不仅是一种更好地理解世界的方式，也是一种感激作为一个个体，你不知道多少东西的方式。 承认这一点的能力不应被视为一种弱点，而应被视为一种优势。 我曾经有一个美术老师，他指出，不仅你能看到的东西很重要，你不能看到的东西也很重要。 当我画静物时，我意识到物体之间的空白对于成功的构图和物体本身一样重要。 正如伟大的教育家孔子所说:“当你知道一件事时，要认识到你知道它;当你不知道一件事时，要认识到你不知道它——这就是知识!”  

It is vital to remain lifelong learners in a rapidly changing world. As you progress through life, you may study and work in new environments. Consequently, you will be exposed to many new ideas, beliefs, practices and learning experiences. Furthermore, the production of knowledge is bound to grow rapidly. New knowledge is constantly being generated and what we already know is being revised all the time, to the extent that it can be difficult to keep pace with the latest developments. Indeed, you may one day do jobs that do not yet exist, use technologies not yet developed and resolve problems that are not yet problems! This is not to suggest that there is no need for you to study in school but to acknowledge that refreshing your knowledge with lifelong learning is both essential and beneficial.  
在这个瞬息万变的世界里，终身学习是至关重要的。随着生活的进步，你可能会在新的环境中学习和工作。因此，你会接触到许多新的思想、信仰、实践和学习经验。此外，知识的生产必然会迅速增长。新知识不断产生，我们已经知道的东西一直在被修改，以至于很难跟上最新的发展。的确，有一天你可能会做一些还不存在的工作，使用尚未开发的技术，解决尚未成为问题的问题! 这并不是说你没有必要在学校学习，而是要认识到，通过终身学习来更新知识是必不可少的，也是有益的。  

So, how can you proceed? Firstly, lifelong learning is an attitude. Lifelong learners are those who have an open mind. Be objective and make yourself open to new knowledge and ideas. Do not criticize them or reject them simply because they differ from what you know and believe. At the same time, lifelong learners need to develop critical thinking skills so that they do not blindly accept new ideas. Instead, they should inquire further to assess the truth of what they are being told. Secondly, take advantage of opportunities for lifelong learning — for example, you could register online and subscribe to e-learning courses, which have increased in recent years. You could also visit the local library where the resources are rich and diverse. Finally, understand that it is not sufficient to simply know something or to understand what you know, because for knowledge to have concrete value, it must be applied. Importantly, after its application, there must then follow a review process of analysis, evaluation and improvement so that your comprehension of the world in which you live becomes a continuous process.  
那么，如何开始行动呢? 首先，终身学习是一种态度。终身学习者是那些思想开放的人。要客观，接受新知识和新思想。不要仅仅因为他们与你所知道和相信的不同就批评或拒绝他们。与此同时，终身学习者需要培养批判性思维的能力，这样他们就不会盲目地接受新思想。相反，他们应该进一步询问，以评估他们被告知的事实的真实性。其次，要抓住机会终身学习——例如，你可以在网上注册并订阅在线学习课程，这类课程近年来有所增加。你也可以参观当地的图书馆，那里的资源丰富多样。最后，要明白，仅仅知道一些东西或理解你所知道的东西是不够的，因为知识要有具体的价值，它必须被应用。重要的是，在应用之后，必须有一个分析、评估和改进的回顾过程，这样你对你所生活的世界的理解就会成为一个持续的过程。  

In summary, in a world of constant changes, one should never cease to learn, because lifelong learning will not only build human capital and improve a career, but also boost self-worth, promote cognition, renew beliefs, and enhance physical and mental health. Therefore, know what you know and use it; know what you do not, know and embrace it; know that you will never know all there is to know and wonder in it.  
综上所述，在一个不断变化的世界里，一个人应该永不停止学习，因为终身学习不仅可以建立人力资本，提高职业生涯，还可以提升自我价值，促进认知，更新信念，增强身心健康。 因此，知道你所知道的并使用它; 知道你所不知道的，了解它，拥抱它; 要知道，你永远不可能知道所有的事情，也不可能在其中感到惊奇。

**My university life**  
**《我的大学生活》**  

I had been waiting with my fellow graduating students for the moment when I would walk out onto the stage to receive my degree certificate. I was happy and relieved, yet worried and anxious about the future. What was my first job going be like? This short walk was going to launch me into a whole new world. How would I manage? Would I be able to carve out a career for myself? My name was called and I moved into the lights. I heard the applause. I knew my parents would be watching and smiling at each other and I tried to relax, I held my certificate to my breast and smiled at the camera. Before I knew it, the ceremony was over and the curtain had come down on my university life. Where had the time gone? Four years had disappeared in a flash. I stood with my certificate in hand and reflected on those four years.  
我和一同毕业的同学们一直在等待走上台领取学位证书的那一刻。我既高兴又放心，但又担心又担心未来。我的第一份工作是什么样子的?这段短短的散步将带我进入一个全新的世界。我该怎么办呢?我能开创自己的事业吗? 有人叫我的名字，我就走到灯光下。我听到了掌声。我知道我的父母会看着我，对着对方微笑，我试着放松，我把我的证书放在胸前，对着镜头微笑。 我还没反应过来，毕业典礼就结束了，我的大学生活也落下了帷幕。时间都到哪里去了? 转眼四年就过去了。我站在那里，手里拿着毕业证，回想着这四年。  

I remembered arriving at university on my very first day, pausing at the gates to look down the long drive. I could feel my hands sweating slightly and I had to hold on tight to my suitcase. Would I be able to fit in? Did this new phase of my life mean that I was now mature enough to be entirely responsible for my own successes and failures? I took a few seconds to compose myself and to take in the scene that was laid out before me. The campus was alive with people. Anxious parents and excited students were talking in small groups, carrying boxes and suitcases or walking in and out of dormitory buildings. I wondered if the first day of school was always such a circus. I took a deep breath and carried on into the heart of the campus. Little did I know that I was about to experience the best four years of my life.  
我记得上大学的第一天，我在大门口停下来，看着漫长的车程。我可以感觉到我的手在冒汗，我不得不紧紧地抓着我的手提箱。 我能适应吗?人生的这个新阶段是否意味着我现在已经足够成熟，可以为自己的成功和失败完全负责?我花了几秒钟让自己镇定下来，欣赏着展现在我面前的景象。校园里人山人海。焦虑的家长和兴奋的学生们正三五成群地交谈，有的拎着箱子，有的在宿舍里进进出出。我在想，开学的第一天是不是总是那么热闹。我深吸了一口气，继续进入校园的中心。我不知道我即将经历我生命中最美好的四年。  

I remembered working on my first assignment. It was a 3,000-word essay on geometry and I wasn’t really sure how to begin the first paragraph. Instead of seeking good advice, I kept putting it off. Rather unwisely, I left it to the las minute. When the deadline approached, I had to stay up working on my laptop all night completing it. The next day I felt ill and started coughing and sneezing. Unsurprisingly, it wasn’t a very good essay. However, this taught me a valuable lesson: as soon as I received the next assignment, I headed straight for the library to find the reference books I needed for my research, and then created an outline followed by a draft. After careful editing and polishing, the result was a much better essay than the last, and it was ready in my desk drawer days before the deadline. I would stick to this approach for the duration of my studies.  
我还记得我的第一个任务。那是一篇3000字的几何论文，我不知道第一段该怎么开头。我没有寻求好的建议，而是一直拖延。我很不明智地把它留到最后一刻。当截止日期临近时，我不得不在我的笔记本电脑上通宵工作来完成它。第二天，我感到不舒服，开始咳嗽和打喷嚏。不出所料，这不是一篇很好的文章。然而，这给我上了宝贵的一课:一接到下一个作业，我就直奔图书馆去找我研究所需的参考书，然后创建一个大纲，接着是草稿。经过仔细的编辑和润色，这篇文章比上一篇好得多，在截止日期前几天就已经放在我的书桌抽屉里了。在我的整个学习过程中，我都会坚持这种方法。  

I remembered cooperating with my classmates on group projects. Everyone would be assigned a specific task, and my role was usually to produce the presentation slides. We would meet in the school cafeteria to bounce ideas off each other, and would laugh and argue and laugh some more as we learnt to work together as a team. I realized that learning didn’t have to be a solo effort and that working with other people could be much more stimulating and productive than working independently.  
我记得与同学合作完成小组项目。 每个人都会被分配到一个特定的任务，而我的角色通常是制作幻灯片。 我们会在学校的自助餐厅见面，互相交流想法，当我们学会像团队一样工作时，我们会笑，会争论，笑得更多。 我意识到学习并不一定是一个人的努力，和其他人一起工作可以比独立工作更刺激和更有成效。  

I remembered visiting my favourite professor, a tall gentleman with his beard and hair going grey, during his office hours for the first time. Initially, I found his strictness intimidating, but quickly came to admire him for his vast knowledge and deep understanding of his subject. It soon dawned on me that many university professors are quite willing to share what they know, and they do take a genuine interest in their students’ intellectual development.  
我记得第一次在我最喜欢的教授的办公时间去拜访他，他是一位高个的绅士，胡子和头发都开始花白了。起初，我觉得他的严格令人生畏，但很快我就开始钦佩他渊博的知识和对学科的深刻理解。 我很快意识到，许多大学教授非常愿意分享他们的知识，而且他们确实对学生的知识水平的发展非常感兴趣。  

I heard my parents’ voices calling me and returned to the moment. After the graduation ceremony we headed home by train. I looked out of the carriage window at the world speeding by. The journey home gave me time to think about what the future might hold for me. University has changed me. Not only am I now more intellectually prepared for the world of work, but I am also more confident about my own abilities. I have grown as an adult and I have also discovered more about myself. Yes, I am ready for a new challenge and the next phase of my life.  
我听到父母在叫我，回到那一刻。 毕业典礼结束后，我们乘火车回家。 我从马车的窗户望出去，看到世界飞驰而过。 回家的旅途让我有时间思考我的未来。 大学改变了我。 现在，我不仅在思想上为工作做好了准备，而且对自己的能力也更加自信了。 我长大成人了，也对自己有了更多的了解。 是的，我已经准备好迎接新的挑战和我人生的下一个阶段。
